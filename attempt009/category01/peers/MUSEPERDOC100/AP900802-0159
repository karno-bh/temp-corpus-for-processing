An emergency Arab League Council failed to

publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to handle the crisis.
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on the crisis.
The Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo at Kuwaiti request hours after Iraqi military forces took over the small Persian Gulf state.
Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again Friday.
