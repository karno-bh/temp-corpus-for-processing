If that's so, said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., "he's the only person gatheredin the room who does not have an opinion.";   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., added,

"I'm concerned about his candor, his willingness to be forthcoming."
Kohl was today's leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day.; Two pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
; Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.; But they hope Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy, Simon and Kohl in voting against the nominee.; Biden and Kennedy declined comment Wednesday on their leanings.; Metzenbaum said Thomas' refusal to give direct answers "makes it more difficult to vote for him."
