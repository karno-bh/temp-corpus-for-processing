In local government elections across Britain

yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever, losing control of 17 regional councils and 444 seats.
As the ruling party, the Tories took just 27 percent of the vote, two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls.
The Labour Party controls 90 local councils, whereas the Conservatives only control 13, with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides.
Even before all of the results were known, some Tories openly announced their determination to challenge John Major's position and remove him from office as early as possible.
Obviously, all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June.
