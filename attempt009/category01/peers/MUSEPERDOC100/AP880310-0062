With no seats and no food for the guests of

honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardi's had gone to the dogs.
The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd.
"He's a very friendly dog," said Nero's master, Officer Joseph Faraguna.
"In all the arrests I've made with him, he's only bitten four times."
Nero was kept on his long leather leash while Prince emerged from his elegant, padded carrying case only long enough to pose for photographers.
