A drug that eases the heart's workload can

cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil, known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years after a heart attack.
According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurring heart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 in people who got the dummy medication.
