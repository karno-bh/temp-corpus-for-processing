The motion picture industry's most coveted

award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
Weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, Oscar was created by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons, who went on to win 11 of the trophies.
According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy given to Spencer Tracy for "Boy's Town" read: "Best Actor: Dick Tracy."
The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and "reserves the right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop," said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.
