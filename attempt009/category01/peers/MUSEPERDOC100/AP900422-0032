Discovery's five astronauts returned

Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
"We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time," said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10.
The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded.
