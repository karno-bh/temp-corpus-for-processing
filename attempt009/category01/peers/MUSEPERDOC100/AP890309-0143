The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected

the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.
It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration.
Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee.
Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to declare her opposition.
