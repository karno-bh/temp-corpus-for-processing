World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R.

Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to build for an event so long awaited by so many.
In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his first reaction was to kneel down and thank God.
"Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last," said Charles Haughey, Irish prime minister and current president of the European Community, which has been using economic sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid.
Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory, but not the investment ban, and has already announced that it is no longer observing the scientific and cultural embargo.
