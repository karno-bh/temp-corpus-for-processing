SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to

begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans.
However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.
Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100.
Official estimates in Miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one Dade County resident in eight - a quarter of a million people.
