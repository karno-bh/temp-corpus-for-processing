Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston

on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines.
The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's airport and aircraft parked on its fields.
"It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane," he said.
Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the island.
