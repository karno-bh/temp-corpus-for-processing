The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew

apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency.
The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense Ministry figures show.
The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation, but said it was a response to a "message of war" delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine days ago.
