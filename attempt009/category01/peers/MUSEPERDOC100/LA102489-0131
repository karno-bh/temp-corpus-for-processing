Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session

within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical.
While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know and when did you know it?"
The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.
