The army on Tuesday dispatched tanks and

troop reinforcements to the frontier with Pakistan, where soldiers from the two nations have been fighting recently, officials and witnesses said.
Singh, who is also defense minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday.
In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian regions.
Despite the tension, officials from both sides said the incidents did not appear to be serious.
"There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incidents will be contained and the situation defused," United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the Parliament.
