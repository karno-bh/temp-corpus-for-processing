President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with

East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.
Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring relations between the two Germanys must involve "all directly interested governments."
Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that "no one can cast doubt" on the reasonableness of asking it.
However, the English-language Tass translation indicated Gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification itself.
Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted "a more positive attitude" toward German reunification.
