As a young girl in western New York,

Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled.
"She always talked about being a star," said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as "daring in many ways."
Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in Jamestown.
"Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to us," said Irene Rosseti of Celoron.
