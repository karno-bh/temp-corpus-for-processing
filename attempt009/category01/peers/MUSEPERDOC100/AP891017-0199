A violent earthquake rocked Northern

California during Tuesday evening's rush hour, caving in a section of the San Francisco Bay Bridge, terrifying World Series fans in Candlestick Park and shaking buildings as far as 200 miles away.
It was not immediately clear how extensive the damage was from the quake, which struck at 5:04 p.m. PDT and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
CBS said the California Highway Patrol reported a J.C. Penney building in downtown Hollister collapsed and a bridge on Highway 101 in Hollister collapsed.
In Washington, President Bush said the federal government was prepared to send help to the earthquake area in California and he was sending Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner there to assess the damage.
