To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor

Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used.
In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926.
It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohito's son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.
But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even official agencies have used the name Hirohito in English-language publications.
