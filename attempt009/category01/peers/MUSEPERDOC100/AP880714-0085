Weather forecasters today were offering

drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms.
On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops.
That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain.
The rest of coastal California also will be dry, the forecast said.
