Former President Reagan thanked British Prime

Minister Margaret Thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down, heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset.
Two years ago, as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with "considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street."
In 1986, when the U.S. bombing of Libya was criticized by world powers, Mrs. Thatcher was the only ally who supported Reagan and allowed the bombers to fly from British bases.
