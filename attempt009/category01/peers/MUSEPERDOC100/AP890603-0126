Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen

Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers.
Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at important intersections nearby.
The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving on the students.
Torched buses and army vehicles on the streets around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke.
Hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square, many dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle.
