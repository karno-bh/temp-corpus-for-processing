In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles

Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.
Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has added local composer Leon Levitch's Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last Sunday.
Last Monday, KUSC-FM (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and compositions of Bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him discussing Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
