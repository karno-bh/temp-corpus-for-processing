Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel declined

Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels "have the right" to try to seize power.
Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquino's forces, as she has demanded.
Laurel, who is known as Doy, broke with Aquino shortly after they took office in 1986 following a popular uprising that toppled former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
Since then, Laurel has criticized Aquino frequently in his role as head of the opposition Nacionalista Party.
He flew to Hong Kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the Philippines' two international airports, in Manila and Cebu, have been closed since the fighting began.
