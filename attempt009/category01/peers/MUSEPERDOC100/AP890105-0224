Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense

secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.
A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
