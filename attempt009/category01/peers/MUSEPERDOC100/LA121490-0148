Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said

goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater.
"Wherever Lenny was, was theater; his every move was a stage direction," he said, as many in the audience laughed knowingly.
Another "West Side Story" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory words: "Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and Jerome Robbins."
His theater scores weren't just a collection of songs but were more like a symphonic work," noted Robbins, who also collaborated on several other ballet and theater works with Bernstein.
