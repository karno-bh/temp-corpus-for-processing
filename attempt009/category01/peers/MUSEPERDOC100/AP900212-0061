Pakistani troops fired on Indian

security forces who stopped a mob of Pakistani protesters from storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, officials said today.
The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region.
Pakistan's top diplomat in New Delhi, Bashir Babar, was summoned to India's Foreign Ministry on Sunday and today and apprised of India's concern over the events, an Indian government spokesman said.
The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India.
