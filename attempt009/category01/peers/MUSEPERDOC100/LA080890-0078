Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the

clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwait's ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday.
Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah said in an interview that he had spoken by telephone to several Kuwaitis taking refuge in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, who reported that the Iraqis had made it easy for them to leave.
That is because the fleeing Kuwaitis apparently are being replaced by Iraqis seeking to meld in with the local population, he contended.
"They are giving them Kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of Kuwait.
