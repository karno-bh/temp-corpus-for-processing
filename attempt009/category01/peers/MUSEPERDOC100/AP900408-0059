The resignation of the land reform

secretary raises doubts about President Corazon Aquino's commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision.
It also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric, Mrs. Aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the 1986 "people power" uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos.
Abad's troubles began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in Cavite province to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park.
But the Department of Agrarian Reform said if the Cavite land was exempted, hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title.
