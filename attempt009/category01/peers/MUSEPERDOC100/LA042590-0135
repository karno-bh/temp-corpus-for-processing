The space shuttle Discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration

when it blasted off Tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe.
The Discovery roared to a record high orbit of 381 miles, where its crew today will ever-so-carefully deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, billed as the finest optical instrument ever created, a $1.5-billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye.
"Every bit of 12 years was worth it," Weiler said moments after Discovery lifted off on a sunny day, pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future.
