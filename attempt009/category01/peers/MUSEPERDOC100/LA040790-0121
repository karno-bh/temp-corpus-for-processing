Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen,

his hometown.
Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position rifle competition Friday en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersen's Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino.
By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set last week in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec.
Bakes once held the record for standing, too, but that was four years ago.
Bakes, a lieutenant in the Czech army, said he was confident after his kneeling performance that he would do well.
