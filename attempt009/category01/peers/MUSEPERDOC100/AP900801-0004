Iraqi troops have launched an offensive

against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, "We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment."
Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to the Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations in the region.
