Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of

Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are missing from the list.
He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as old-guard managers of scientific institutions.
Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political prisoner.
