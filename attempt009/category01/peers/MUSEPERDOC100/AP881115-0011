Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August

was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra.
At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was the Philharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as his assistant, was introduced from a box.
Eight others who also were members in 1943 _ violinist Louis Fishzohn, oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch, cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker, and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano _ went on stage.
