Overcrowding and safety violations caused

an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River, killing as many as 400 people, a government report said.
A senior government official, discussing the confidential report on condition of anonymity, said authorities believed at least 300 people on the lower deck died when the ferry overturned Saturday morning.
Authorities believe about 100 people swam to safety or were rescued by villagers.
Many lives could have been saved if the ferry had carried water safety equipment such as life jackets," said the senior official.
"We are trying our best, but because of the current, we are not able to go near the launch," Pathak said.
