Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the

request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade.
The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.
Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi action "an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup d'etat from within."
The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
The official Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did not issue a single story all day.
