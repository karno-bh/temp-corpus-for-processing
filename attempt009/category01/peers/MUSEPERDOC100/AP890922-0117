An explosion today flattened a military

barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and injuring 22, police said.
More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal.
One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that were destroyed.
However, King told reporters the attack was directed against "unarmed bandsmen."
The music school is the training center for young recruits who want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands.
