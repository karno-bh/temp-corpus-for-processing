Strikes by tens of thousands of

miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the Soviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.
Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions.
Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s.
Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returned to work after the government made pay concessions.
