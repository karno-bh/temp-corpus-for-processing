The Oscar statuette, one of the most

recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.
The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
