A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver

transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.
The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr.
In other respects, however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced.
Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken under full Soviet control in 1944.
The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people.
