As a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland 7,000 miles away,

supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match Thursday night with supporters of President Corazon Aquino at the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles.
About 30 members of the Filipino-American Movement for a Better Philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on Wilshire Boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan.
"These people staging the coup are criminals," Lamila yelled.
Greg Santillas of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence said he believes that most of the estimated 350,000 Filipinos living in Los Angeles County oppose the military coup.
