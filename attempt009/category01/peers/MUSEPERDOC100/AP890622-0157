A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests

that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday.
During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck "sitting upright and proud" two weeks ago.
Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
