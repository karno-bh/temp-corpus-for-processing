Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free

of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests.
Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in Germany.
The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.
The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.
