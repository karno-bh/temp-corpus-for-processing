TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the

four relay finals.
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
