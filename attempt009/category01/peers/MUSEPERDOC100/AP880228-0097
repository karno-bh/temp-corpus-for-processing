Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when

the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
Blair also won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's only double winner.
Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and banners reading "Until We Meet Again" in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
