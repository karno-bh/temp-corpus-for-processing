The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the

former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts, and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia (whose potential number is estimated at more than 2m).
They believe that the problems in some of the former Soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood.
If uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to European security, including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism.
