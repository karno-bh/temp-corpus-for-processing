A strong earthquake triggered landslides

and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than 1,500, officials and news reports said.
More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the eastern Indian state of Bihar, officials said.
Officials in both countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received reports from remote areas which were hit harder.
"Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses," said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
