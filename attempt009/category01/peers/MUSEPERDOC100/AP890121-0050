Grief-stricken family and friends mourned

the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town.
Parents and teachers continued counseling the children who witnessed Tuesday's schoolyard slayings, trying to help them deal with the tragedy.
Patrick Purdy, 24, opened fire outside the Cleveland Elementary School with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, firing more than 100 rounds, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one teacher.
Three days and nights of prayer began Thursday for two of the youngsters killed, and services for the other children were being held today and Monday.
