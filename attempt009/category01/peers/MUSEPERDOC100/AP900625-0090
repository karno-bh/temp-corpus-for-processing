The bodies of four Moslems were found in

a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they were kidnapped by Moslem militants agitating for secession from India.
The bodies, which had bullet wounds, were found in the town of Sopore about 35 miles northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar, said police officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
Anonymous callers to local newspapers and news agency offices said the four were killed by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they were police informers.
Police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar.
