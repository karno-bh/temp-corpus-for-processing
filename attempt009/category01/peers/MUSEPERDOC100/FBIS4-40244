Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy,

today reminded us of his existence.
[Correspondent Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950, Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR, soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the restoration of the USSR.
During the October events he left the White House with a head wound and was taken to hospital.
He began it with a short statement, the essence of which comes down to the fact that the adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human rights, but creates the conditions for a conflict similar, in his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.
