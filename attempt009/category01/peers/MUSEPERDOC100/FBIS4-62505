Dushanbe 16 May TASS -- The Tajik Communist Party

has called for the restoration of a renovated Soviet Union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political, economic, and spiritual potential of former Soviet republics.
Tajik communists' leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics.
Radical market reforms "imposed by quasi- democrats" and "wild privatisation" have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger, he said.
He noted that the majority of the population support Tajik communists' call for the restoration of the Soviet Union.
