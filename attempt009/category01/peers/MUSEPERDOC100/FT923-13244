RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic

fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders.
In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people.
