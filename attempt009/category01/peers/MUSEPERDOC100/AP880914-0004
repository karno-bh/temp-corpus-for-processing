Gilbert, an ``extremely dangerous hurricane'' and one of the

strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as "a great hurricane ... in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and destructive potential."
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ a 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
Mexico's news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in the Yucatan resorts of Cancun and Cozumel Island.
