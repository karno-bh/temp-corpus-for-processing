The government on Thursday allowed for the

possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.
In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting Europe.
He said German reunification "cannot go ahead" of the reunification of Europe.
Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk, Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers "no political changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic integrations."
