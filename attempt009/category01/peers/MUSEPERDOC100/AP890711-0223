He's ranked as the richest man in the

nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville, a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
"He is unavailable," said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
"He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company," Shinkle said.
Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in October 1985.
