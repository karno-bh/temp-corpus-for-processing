John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of

London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday as Britain's next prime minister.
In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory.
Appearing outside his official residence at No. 11 Downing St., next to the prime minister's, Major declared Tuesday evening, "We are going to unite totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election."
When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same.
