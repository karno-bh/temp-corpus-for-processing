Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman

could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.
Emma Nicholson, a Conservative Party lawmaker, said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a British prime minister.
"What has it ever done for me?"
Several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries, but the only woman to serve in a Thatcher Cabinet was Baroness Young, leader of the House of Lords from 1981 to 1983.
Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.
