Moslem extremists abducted a leading

businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training, police said.
Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostages were seized, and soldiers tightened security around the Kashmir Valley, where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem separatist movement.
The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state.
The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not be confirmed.
