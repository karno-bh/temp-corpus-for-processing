Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State

Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days.
Due to interaction of the Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang, the Zhujiang Delta will face a high water-level test.
Heavy rainfall over a wide area since mid-June resulted in the largest flood waters since liberation of the country in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, and Xiang Jiang rivers.
