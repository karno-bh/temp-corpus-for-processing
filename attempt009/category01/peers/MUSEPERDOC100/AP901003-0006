An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol

of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
In the operation, doctors change the route of the small intestine so about one-third of it is bypassed.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, it was 39 percent.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
