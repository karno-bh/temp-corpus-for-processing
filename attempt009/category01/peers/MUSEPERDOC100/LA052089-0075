President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not

permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
Hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly Friday but remained in extremely critical condition.
The 71-year-old former president has been suffering from heart, lung and kidney disorders as well as pneumonia.
Medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart medication but that he could die at "any time."
"I have said . . . in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incident."
