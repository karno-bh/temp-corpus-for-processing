A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of

Vulcanology and Seismology said.; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
That is what killed 38 people in Japan last week.; Such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base, Lipman said.; Planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash -- indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds -- run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit.; So far, the winds have blown ash away from the base.
