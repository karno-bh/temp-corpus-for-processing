East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich

Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
