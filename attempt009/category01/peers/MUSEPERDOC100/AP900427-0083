The lens cover on the Hubble Space

Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
"You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own," Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened.
"There are handshakes and smiles all around up here," said Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on Wednesday.
When the door opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working and the electronic system went into an automatic "safe mode" in which all motion is stopped.
