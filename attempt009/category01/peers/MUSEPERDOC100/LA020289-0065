President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former

CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday.
The choice is James R. Lilley, a career intelligence officer who served as CIA station chief in China when Bush headed the U.S. liaison office there in 1974-75.
May Face Tough Questioning They said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block Aronson's nomination but said that the former Jimmy Carter aide will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings.
In that job, he was the principal American contact with South Korean leaders during the turbulent period when former President Chun Doo Hwan resigned and the current president, Roh Tae Woo, won a bitterly contested election.
