Moslem militants killed five people who

opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
At least 195 people, mostly Moslem demonstrators, have been killed in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
They were identified as a deputy police superintendent; the 73-year-old local leader of the Communist Party of India; the grandson of another prominent Communist leader; and a man accused of being a police informer.
In December, Mustafa helped negotiate a prisoner exchange in which the kidnapped daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeed was swapped for five prominent members of the radical Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
