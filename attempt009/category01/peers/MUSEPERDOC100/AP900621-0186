The earthquake that devastated Iran early

Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
"Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you," said Russ Needham, a geophysist with the U.S. Geological Survey that monitors ground motion around the world.
The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, he said.
