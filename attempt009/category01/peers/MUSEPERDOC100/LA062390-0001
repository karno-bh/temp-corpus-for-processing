Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call

from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht, Iran, with her family.
About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands.
When he did, some quick time-zone arithmetic showed that he had talked to his wife just minutes before the quake happened.
One of about 25,000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state, Nyakoui was luckier than most: His wife managed to call him a second time that day, about eight hours after the quake, to tell him she and their two children were safe.
