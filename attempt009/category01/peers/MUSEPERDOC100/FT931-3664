MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay

stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured.
'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed.
Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.
The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.
