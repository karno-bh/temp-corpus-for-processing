Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears

for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with prayers and applause.
There never will be another one like her.
All three memorial Masses began at 8 p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were often broadcast.
"A God who would have created her would never let her laughter be far from Him," said Ms. Sawyer.
In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball "to show us life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending."
