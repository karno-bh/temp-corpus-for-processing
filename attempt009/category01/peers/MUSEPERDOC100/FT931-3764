THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last

night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand.
All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon.
More than 2,000 people died in riots, including over 700 in Bombay, after the razing of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India by Hindu zealots on December 6.
The bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the former federal defence minister just re-appointed chief minister of Maharashtra state, said all roads into Bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert.
