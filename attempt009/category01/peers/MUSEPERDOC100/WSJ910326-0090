Mr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his

60th Boston Marathon.
Bill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans to run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: "It's incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he's doing.
"Aghast is more like it," says Leslie Pawson, 86, a three-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a century ago.
Though he isn't the oldest person ever to enter the Boston Marathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it.
Today, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, covered by TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogether in prize money.
