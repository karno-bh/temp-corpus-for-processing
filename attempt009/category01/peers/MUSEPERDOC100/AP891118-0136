Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President

Dan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.
Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.
"The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ... regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that they could survive," said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov. Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby.
President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of natural disasters.
