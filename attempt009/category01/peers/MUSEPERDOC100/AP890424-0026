Navy investigators will be looking at all

possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials say.
A seven-member team of investigators boarded the battleship a day after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret on Wednesday.
"They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error, or anything technical," said Lt. Janet Mescus, a spokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
