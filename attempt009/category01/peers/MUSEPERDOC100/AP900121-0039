Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in

the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said.
Fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday, while six were fatally wounded late Saturday night, according to Mohammad Nomani, inspector general of Srinagar police.
Nomani, speaking by telephone from Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, said the fighting tapered off late Sunday afternoon as heavy rains lashed the city.
The separatists, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, have often attacked government offices and police officials.
