While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind

roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
But the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city, which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years.
As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office.
On his desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss of power.
I've never been in one and I hope I'm never in one again," Riley said.
