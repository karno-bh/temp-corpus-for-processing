Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her

position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term, opposition leaders and political observers said.
"I think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch," she told the newspaper.
"My guess is that the Tory party will want someone as leader who could take them through the next Parliament," Callaghan said.
The newspaper predicted the opposition Labor Party will try to promote leader Neil Kinnock as "the occupant-in-waiting of 10 Downing St., who is ready, able and willing to complete a full term."
