Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat,

will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N. officials said Tuesday.
Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the United States.
Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday.
