Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the

curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell.
The musical tells the tycoon's life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from Gilbert and Sullivan.
The attorney-general's move to close down a West End production before its first night is regarded as without precedent.
The musical, which has cost Pounds 1.1m to put on, has been produced by Mr Evan Steadman, a former chairman of one of Maxwell's private companies.
Mr Steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorney-general's application for an injunction would be contested.
