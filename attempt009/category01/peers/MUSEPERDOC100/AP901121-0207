Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music

in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh McCracken and other New York-based sessions players.
"His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about John Lennon," said Newmark, who still lives in New York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.
Once recording began, Lennon was just a "working musician" with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.
