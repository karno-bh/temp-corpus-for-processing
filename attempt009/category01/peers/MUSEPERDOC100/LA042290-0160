Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed

launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m.
The ship's five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit.
"We're off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said.
With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission.
