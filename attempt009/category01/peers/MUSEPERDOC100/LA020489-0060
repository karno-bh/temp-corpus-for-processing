More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at

Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
For families who are thinking about getting a dog, this is a chance to size up the possibilities and talk with pet owners about the advantages and disadvantages of different breeds.
Around the arena, owners will be busy grooming and cajoling their charges into center-ring readiness.
Between judgings, a troupe of Dobermans will jump through hoops and barrels and will scale walls.
In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and locate the jackets of their owners.
