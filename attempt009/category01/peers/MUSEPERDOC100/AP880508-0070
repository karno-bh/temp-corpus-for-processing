A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting

Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students.
Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony.
They hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said: "Honor Nelson Mandela."
Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no effort was made to include them.
