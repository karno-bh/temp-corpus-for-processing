Here is a brief chronology in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over oil

production and their common border.
July 20: Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors -- including Kuwait -- to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
July 24: The U.S. Defense Department announces that Navy warships and aircraft are holding a "short-notice exercise" in the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border.
July 25: Baghdad says that it will not be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring Kuwait, and Hussein summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.
