Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private

humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran.
The U.S. military, which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need, stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any U.S. aid requested by Iran.
Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations.
Amir Zamani, a spokesman for the Iranian mission at the United Nations, welcomed the "many offers from many organizations" that his office has received.
