In the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a Bush

Administration Cabinet nominee, a prominent conservative told a Senate panel Tuesday that John Tower may lack the "moral character" to be secretary of defense.
"We've had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee, and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge," said committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.)
"It is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life," Weyrich said.
Saying that "Nixon went to China," Bush added that Tower's record of support for Pentagon spending hikes could be overturned.
