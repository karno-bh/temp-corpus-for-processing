Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major

yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election this autumn.
But the concerted show of support failed to dispel doubts among Tory MPs about his chances of staying in office.
Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in an INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out.
The leadership is hoping that over the Easter recess the Conservative constituencies will urge their MPs to stop the damaging in-fighting which they believe is overshadowing the Government's fightback on the economy, law and order and education.
