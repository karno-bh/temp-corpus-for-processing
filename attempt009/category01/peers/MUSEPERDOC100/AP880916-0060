Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low

pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn't "is a mystery more or less," said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
"If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation," Bleck said.
