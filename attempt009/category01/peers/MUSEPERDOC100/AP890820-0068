A Florida couple said their pleasure boat

was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard reported Sunday.
William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were "weak but recovering" at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by telephone early Sunday.
William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by "several" whales on June 15 about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
