Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for

clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones.
Officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a Navy ship in more than a decade, a blast that ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret during naval exercises Wednesday in the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico.
As the Iowa headed toward its home port in Norfolk, Va., the flag-draped, metal coffins containing the bodies of the 47 seamen killed arrived at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, site of the largest military mortuary.
