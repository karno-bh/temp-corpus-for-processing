the vault while the shop came down around them.
Those were among the stories people in this northern Alabama city swapped on Thursday as they assessed the damage from a tornado that whipped through the heart of the city in a flash, leaving at least 17 people dead and hundreds homeless.
"Everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the roof started to fall," recalled Vincent Davis, a fourth-grader at Jones Valley Elementary School.
Vincent was staying late at school Wednesday when the twister hit shortly after 4:30 p.m.
When I opened my eyes and looked around, there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments used to be."
