A leader of the Moslem separatist

movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire.
Tens of thousands of Moslems gathered later for the funeral.
Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, was a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, a leading separatist group.
Hours later, thousands of residents gathered near Wani's house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew.
The firing continued intermittently for more than one hour until the body wa interred at 5 p.m. "We will carry forward Asfaq's mission, which was to gain independence," said one militant leader holding a Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifle.
