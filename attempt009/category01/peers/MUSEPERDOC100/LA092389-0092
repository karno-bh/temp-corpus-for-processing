The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday

that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away.
But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA.
He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA's last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August, 1988.
