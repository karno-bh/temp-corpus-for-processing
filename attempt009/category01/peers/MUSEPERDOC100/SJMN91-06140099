He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even asthe world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating

his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit.; To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States.; "We're preserving history," says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator.
; If so, Huntington will be ready.; Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have donated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, a coffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote, signed or posed for.; The vice president's mother, Corinne, donated a lock of his baby hair.
