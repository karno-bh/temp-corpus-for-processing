U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime prime

minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a television documentary claims.
The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S. prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.
The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among other things that he: _Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at Nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from the China front.
