West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday

that "the way is now free" for German reunification.
His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told West German radio, that the two German states should "enter into negotiations as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election.
"Political and economic union go hand in hand," Kohl said.
Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an "economic breakthrough" in East Germany, which in turn could provide a "push forward" for all of Europe.
