The actor who played Little Ricky on the

"I Love Lucy" show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played the comedian's TV son.
"She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death," said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world.
That led to an audition for the "I Love Lucy" role in Hollywood.
