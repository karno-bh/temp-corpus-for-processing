Thousands of grieving friends and relatives

of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS Iowa gathered quietly Monday and heard President Bush praise their loved ones as "brothers in eternity."
"We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact, for the 11 who survived," the president told a packed memorial service at Norfolk Naval Air Station.
They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left the Navy as brothers in eternity.
Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the service.
