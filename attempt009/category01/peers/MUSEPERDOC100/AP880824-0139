The death toll from the Himalayan

earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of Nepal and found more bodies.
Residents in Dharan, the worst-hit area of Nepal, also raced from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in Katmandu said.
No further damage was reported in the city, where 100 houses collapsed during the quake.
Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in Dharan on Wednesday that were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector G. Adhikari said.
To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains that began in late June.
