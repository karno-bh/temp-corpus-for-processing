Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns.

The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald.
McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul.
The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young.
The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here.
"We're hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year.
After that, we'd like to open five every year."
