Sports Illustrated is taking 300 advertisers to Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, Calif., this weekend for an all-out bash.

Along with getting seats for Sunday's game, the guests will brunch at the chic Spago restaurant, take a private tour of Universal Studios and attend a wing-ding at the Century Plaza Hotel.
One big change under the new law limits business-entertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the Super Bowl: Only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted.
The tougher IRS rule, however, hasn't slowed ticket demand; even end-zone seats are fetching $500 each.
A spokesman for Adolph Coors &amp; Co, the Golden, Colo., brewery, said its tax advisers instructed executives that "this can't be just a fun trip -- we have to discuss business."
