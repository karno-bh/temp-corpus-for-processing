A natural substance called transforming growth

factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
