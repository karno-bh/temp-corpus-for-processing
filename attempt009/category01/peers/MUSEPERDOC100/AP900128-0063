The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver

Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super Bowl victory ever.
The 49ers' win in the 24th Super Bowl made them the first repeat NFL champion in a decade and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a pinnacle of Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries.
San Francisco won the National Football League championship game in 1989, 1985 and 1982.
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana made five touchdown passes, three to Jerry Rice, breaking a Super Bowl record for touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13 straight pass completions.
He also set five Super Bowl career records, including his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and San Francisco's point total was the most ever.
