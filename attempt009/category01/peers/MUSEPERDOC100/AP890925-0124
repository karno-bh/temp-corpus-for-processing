Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said

Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are "monsters" who will be found and punished.
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks, saying "she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the conflict, its cause and the remedy."
After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the hospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: "The hunt for the bombers will be pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication."
