Recordings by Leonard Bernstein, one of the most documented conductors in

history, will undergo expanded release programs following the conductor's death on Sunday, said representatives of the recording companies controlling the late Bernstein's catalogues.
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD."
