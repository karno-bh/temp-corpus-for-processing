Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school

playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said today.
The revelation's significance was not immediately clear, although it appeared to suggest that the attack at Cleveland Elementary was not altogether random.
Other relatives described Purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced across America, looking for work as a welder.
Cleveland Elementary was in session today, although only a little more than 200 pupils -- roughly one-fourth of the student body -- showed up for classes.
