The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern

Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents, National Guard Capt. Jim Boling said.
One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt.
That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to 19, including five children.
