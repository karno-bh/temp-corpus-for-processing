The most intense hurricane on record

surged toward Texas today after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee.
Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
Earlier this week the storm struck the Carribean, ravaging Jamaica, the Dominican Repubic, the Cayman Islands and Haiti, killing at least 19 in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic.
Haiti declared a state of emergency across its southern peninsula, where at least 10 hurricane-related deaths have been reported.
