Port workers in Szczecin and

southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition activists said.
In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity officials said.
The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites.
