The Communist Party today admitted

that East Germany's socialist system has failed, and expressed support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the country's increasingly troubled situation.
Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said "socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our country" and acknowledged that the "popular revolutionary movement" of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old system.
The meeting brought together officials of the United States, France and Britain with Soviet officials, who have increasingly expressed concern over calls in both Germanys to reunite the country.
