Three decades ago, a West German

politician said German reunification was a "sleeping lioness" that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
"We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago."
"If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany," added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.
"Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances," the Times' futuristic view continued.
