Forty years after Sam Walton first hung

out his shingle, Walton's 5&amp;10 will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire.
It concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how Wal-Mart thrived when similar companies didn't.
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his "dance on Wall Street," which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
The old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nation's biggest discount retailer behind K mart Corp. of Detroit.
