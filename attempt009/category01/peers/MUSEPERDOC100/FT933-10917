THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty

language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised some people.
It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public.
In public, they have to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness.
