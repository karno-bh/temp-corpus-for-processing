They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigationalchannels. The 1,105-ton ship went down Saturday night about six miles off the

Egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy 10-foot seas.; "We are looking for both survivors and bodies," said Brig. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar, Egypt's deputy chief of port security.
; Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreck scene by strong winds.; Ahmed Gamal Sobhi, Safaga's city council chairman, said only four bodies were recovered by Egyptian vessels and helicopters and the time nightfall and bad weather stopped Sunday's search.; The weather improved today as two helicopters from the U.S. Navy frigate Aubrey Fitch, which joined in the rescue effort on Sunday night, and a Navy P-3 submarine-chaser aircraft made their first daylight search runs, said Lt. Cmdr. Rudolph Brewington, a Pentagon duty officer.; "They've observed lots of wreckage, empty life rafts, an oil slick but no additional bodies and no survivors," he said.; Survivors said that after the ship struck the reef, crew members herded them to one side of the listing boat to keep it from heeling over, then pushed passengers aside to get to the lifeboats.; "They went off in a boat," passenger Abdel-A'ati Hassan, 31, said from his hospital bed in Safaga.
