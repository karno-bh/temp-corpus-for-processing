Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign

nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading the emirate.
Several hundred Britons, Americans and West Germans were grabbed in the hotels, and some were taken to Iraq, the West German and British foreign ministries said.
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the invasion.
The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that they should not forget their citizens in Kuwait while heaping on economic punishments, and today's roundup appeared to be a reaction against the sanctions.
