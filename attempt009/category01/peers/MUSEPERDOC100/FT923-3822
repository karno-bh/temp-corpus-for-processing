THE annual Booker ballyhoo got going again yesterday when the judges for

this year's Pounds 20,000 prize for British (and Commonwealth) fiction announced the shortlist.
The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.
Its critics say that the autumn brouhaha distorts the annual fiction industry and the intense media hype of the shortlisted authors does a disservice to the hordes of other gifted but unlisted writers.
London's litterati have for weeks been betting on Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient - those of them who have seen a proof copy because it is not officially published until next week.
