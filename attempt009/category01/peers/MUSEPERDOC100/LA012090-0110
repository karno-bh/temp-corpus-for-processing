Though the historic McMartin Pre-School criminal trial finally has ended in

acquittals, a host of civil lawsuits generated by the Manhattan Beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades, legal experts say.
"I'm convinced this case will never end," Eli Gauna, who represents Babette Spitler, a former teacher at the school, said wearily.
A decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against Ray Buckey.
Defendants included Buckey; his mother; his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who was the school founder; his sister Peggy Ann Buckey; and teachers Spitler, Betty Raidor and Mary Ann Jackson.
