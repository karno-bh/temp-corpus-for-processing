Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of

Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny.
Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
"I personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only one I've ever really known."
In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in "The Lucy Show" from 1962-68.
