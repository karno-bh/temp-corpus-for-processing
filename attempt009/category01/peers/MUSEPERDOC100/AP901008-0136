McDonald's hamburgers, fries and golden

arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.
"I travelled for four hours from a village to get here," said Huang Rongti, 70, who has lost most of her teeth because of age.
Later, after purchasing her first Big Mac, she inspected it carefully before taking a bite.
"It tastes good, I like it," she announced before slowly eating the rest.
In Canton, 125 miles northwest of Shenzhen, chefs specialize in some of the more exotic Chinese dishes, such as cat stew, bear paws, chicken feet and a famed snake dish - "Dragon and Tiger Locked in Battle" - made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat, and garnished with 20 spices, lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals.
