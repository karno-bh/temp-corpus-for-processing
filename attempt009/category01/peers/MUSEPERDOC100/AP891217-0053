Mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief

Sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flower-draped body of Andrei D. Sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his country's conscience.
Based on official sources, an estimated 45,000 people filed through, and the flow of mourners continued into the night.
Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies, and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of Gorky.
The huge line of mourners, sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against below-zero temperatures, stretched a mile from the palace and poured continuously out of a subway station.
