Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse dropped

sharply Thursday, but the vital signs later returned to normal as the ailing monarch's internal bleeding continued.
Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 in the afternoon to 112 over 50 by evening, and his pulse from 104 per minute in the morning to 84 in the evening, said Kenji Maeda, chief of the Imperial Household Agency's General Affairs Division.
"The emperor's blood pressure has returned to what is normal for him, and the head court physician says he is not worried," Maeda said.
One of Hirohito's daughters, Atsuko Ikeda, said Wednesday the emperor had coughed severely during her visit to him and had hardly responded to her.
