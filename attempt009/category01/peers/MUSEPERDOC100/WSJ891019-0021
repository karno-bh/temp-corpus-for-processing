The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly.

In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action.
By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.
