Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the

"senseless" killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA bombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned all military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, southeast Britain.
One simply wonders what sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts.
The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughter of Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in 1979.
