The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.

Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. "Star Wars" program.
That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United States, which began Sunday.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into Afghanistan.
