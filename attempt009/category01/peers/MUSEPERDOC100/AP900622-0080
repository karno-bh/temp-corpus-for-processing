Soldiers from three nations locked the doors

of Checkpoint Charlie today and a crane whisked away the Cold War relic that symbolized a divided world.
"For 29 years Checkpoint Charlie embodied the Cold War," U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on Berlin's Friedrich Street.
Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from France, Britain and the two Germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change.
Shevardnadze called for the removal of Berlin's status as an Allied-controlled city and the withdrawal of troops within six months after the two German states unify, which could come in December.
