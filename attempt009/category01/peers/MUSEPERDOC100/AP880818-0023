Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for

vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, "I'd say, 'there stands the next Thomas Jefferson."'
"John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years."
The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in "The Candidate" sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.
