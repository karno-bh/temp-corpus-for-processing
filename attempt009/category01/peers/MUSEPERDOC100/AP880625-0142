President Corazon Aquino has agreed

to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars, newspapers said Saturday.
The Manila Bulletin and The Manila Chronicle quoted Mrs. Aquino's press secretary, Teodoro Benigno, as saying that Mrs. Aquino made the assurance to two Swiss lawyers before she visited Switzerland earlier this month.
The unidentified Swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over "unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him," Benigno was quoted as saying.
