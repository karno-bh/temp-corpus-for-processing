Dozens of fans of rock legend and

former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
Journalist Andy Peebles, the last person to interview Lennon before he was shot, said in an interview with Sky satellitetelevision news: "Ten years on, it's a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent ... seven hours ... with somebody you have been a fan of for years, and I think I left ... thinking 'This is great, he's in really good shape."'
