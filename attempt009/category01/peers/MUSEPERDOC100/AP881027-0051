More than 100 people were feared drowned

after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern Bangladesh, police said today.
Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
They said about 100 people on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull were unable to save themselves.
Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the M.L. Sonali, and nine others were found more than a mile downstream.
