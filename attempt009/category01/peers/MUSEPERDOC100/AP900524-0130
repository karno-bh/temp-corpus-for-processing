Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on

Thursday accused India of waging "genocide" in secession-minded Kashmir and of trying to start a war with Pakistan to deflect attention.
The two countries, which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965, have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the common border.
"India is indulging in genocide," Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Ms. Bhutto returned late Wednesday from visits to Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, North Yemen, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, a high-profile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for Pakistan's stand on the Kashmir issue.
