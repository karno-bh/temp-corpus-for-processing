The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has

found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday.
Concerns About Veracity The discrepancy, sources said, has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation.
In his testimony, Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a half-dozen U.S. defense firms that do business with the Pentagon.
A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees.
