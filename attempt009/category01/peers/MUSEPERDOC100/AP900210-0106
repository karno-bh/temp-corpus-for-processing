About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West

German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
Waigel's comments came after a day after a high-ranking official in Bonn warned that East Germany is rapidly approaching insolvency.
The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
