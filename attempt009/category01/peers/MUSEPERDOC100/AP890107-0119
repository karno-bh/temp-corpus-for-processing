World leaders sent Japan messages of condolences and some

declared states of mourning after Emperor Hirohito's death Saturday, but painful memories of World War II still generated criticism of the Japanese monarch.
While President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea sent his condolences, a government party statement added, "We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship."
But Taiwan's daily United Evening News said: "It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to China to show his sorrow."
