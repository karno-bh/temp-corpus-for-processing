On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his

sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his "Mass" and "Chichester Psalms."
Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron Copland.
And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
The concert began with selections from Bernstein's "Mass," which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew, from Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms."
