Cement blocks were all that remained of

homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town after a furious flash flood.
Residents donned shorts and hip-waders Friday to begin putting their lives back together after 5{ inches of rain fell in 3{ hours late Thursday, churning floodwaters that left at least 11 people dead and 51 others missing early today.
The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink, whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty, including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.
