Hurricane Gilbert battered the resorts of

the Yucatan Peninsula today with 160 mph winds and torrential rains.
Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Florida, said early today he expects Gilbert to make landfall on the Texas-Louisiana coast in 48 to 60 hours.
Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, according to reports from New Orleans.
Pereira, who spoke by telephone from Mexico City, said heavy rain was falling over the peninsula and communications with Cancun and Cozumel were out.
Heavy rains began in Merida about 6 a.m. EDT, and the storm was expected to dump 5 to 10 inches on the area.
