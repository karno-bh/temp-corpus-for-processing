The committee will continue to hear testimony for and against Thomas atleast through the end of the week, but the outcome does not seem to be in

Several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend, by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote, that the Senate confirm Thomas.
Regardless of the outcome, Thomas said on his way out of the hearing, "I have been treated fairly."
; Before Thomas' testimony ended, the unflappable 43-year-old federal judge was criticized, sometimes in harsh terms, by several liberal Democrats.
; Kennedy listed 10 instances in which he said Thomas had abandoned or contradicted his previous positions.; Kennedy told Thomas he had "walked away" from his record on the right to privacy, refused to comment on its application to abortion and asked lawmakers "to believe that an intelligent and outspoken person like yourself has never discussed Roe vs. Wade (the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling) with another human being."
