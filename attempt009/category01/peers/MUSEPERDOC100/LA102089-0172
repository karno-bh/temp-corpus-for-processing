On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his

apartment after the deadly earthquake.
"The buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design," said Peter I. Yanev, chairman of EQE Engineering Inc., a structural engineering firm in San Francisco.
"They were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city," explained Yanev, who said he has traveled to "all the major earthquakes" in the last 20 years studying their impact on construction.
The soil beneath the Marina District, where six buildings burned down or collapsed, is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than 70 years ago.
