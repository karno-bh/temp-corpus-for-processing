President Bush is expected to name a female

career diplomat as U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under President-elect Violeta Chamorro, according to informed sources.
In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
The Sandinista government expelled then-U.S. ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
The Reagan administration retaliated by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the Nicaraguan embassy here.
