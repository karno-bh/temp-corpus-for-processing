What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary

Grant, Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg have in common?
Oscar's 60-year history is filled with examples of the film world's highest achievers being overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie "Broadcast News" was nominated though he wasn't, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his "Empire of the Sun."
Alfred Hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an Oscar: "I suppose it was a matter of carelessness."
