President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that

thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms.
Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's top coal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from 20 on Tuesday to 58 today.
"Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike as of Aug. 1," Gorbachev said during the parliamentary session, which was broadcast on television and radio.
Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the number appeared to be rising.
