A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on

maneuvers in the Atlantic today, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said.
Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a 110-pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to 23 miles.
The aircraft carrier Coral Sea steamed to the scene, sending out helicopters to land supplies and medical crews on the ship.
Guns Date From 1943 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. William Crowe were informed of the incident while attending a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels.
