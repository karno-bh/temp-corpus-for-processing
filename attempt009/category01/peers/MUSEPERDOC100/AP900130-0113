The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the

Denver Broncos was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years and the third-lowest ever.
Despite the low rating, Sunday's game was seen by about 108.5 million people, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in the United States behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of "MASH."
The higher viewership was made possible by the annual increase in the number of homes with television.
The 49ers won by the biggest margin in Super Bowl history.
Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the 49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes, according to Nielsen estimates.
