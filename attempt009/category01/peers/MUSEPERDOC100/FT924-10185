RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled

Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia, 1,100 miles south of Moscow.
The troops were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes.
A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
