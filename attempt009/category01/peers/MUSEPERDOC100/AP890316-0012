John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.

For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats.
Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
The good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
But it will be a debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that was ordained long before the Tower episode.
