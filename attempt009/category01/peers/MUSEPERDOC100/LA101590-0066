Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist,

composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
Cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left Bernstein too weak to continue working.
With it, he became a personality, well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show.
Describing the conductor in the same concert, Bernheimer referred to him as "the shrugging, jumping, sighing, soaring, gushing, crouching, rocking, rolling, bounding, bobbing, leaping, jiggling, stabbing, hunching, bumping, grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis."
