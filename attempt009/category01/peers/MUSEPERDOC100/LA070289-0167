Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the

country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms.
As president, Gorbachev said, it is his "duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society, for every family and for every person."
"Irresponsible slogans, political instigation, setting one national group against another, the domination of some ethnic groups by others -- this could lead to disaster for us all.
"The living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness."
