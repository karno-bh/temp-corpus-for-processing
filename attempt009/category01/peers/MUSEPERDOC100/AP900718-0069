The government today imposed direct

federal rule in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
Before direct federal rule was imposed today on Jammu-Kashmir state, it was administered temporarily by a governor, a federal representative, since Jan. 18.
On Tuesday, at least 29 militants were killed by Indian security forces in Kashmir, the Moslem-dominated northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign.
Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said 21 militants were killed in a battle with the Border Security Force in Poonch, 400 miles northwest of New Delhi.
