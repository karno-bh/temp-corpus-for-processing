Iraq's powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this

small, oil-rich kingdom.
Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials said.
Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded.
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area.
Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn.
