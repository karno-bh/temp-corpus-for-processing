Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable

property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87.
He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son.
Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress dowager.
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother.
Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about 3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state, the tax office official said.
