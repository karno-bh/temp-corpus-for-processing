Federal aid was approved Friday for

tornado-ravaged Huntsville, where 17 died and several hundred were injured or lost their homes, and Gov. Guy Hunt toured hospitals and visited with grieving families.
"I've been around a lot of tornadoes, but I've not seen the type of damage on as broad a scale as I've seen this morning," Hunt said after a helicopter tour of the 10-mile-long path of destruction.
More than 400 people were injured, with about 80 still under care in hospitals when Hunt visited patients' rooms Friday.
Grant Peterson, associate director of the federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday he hopes that offices can be opened Sunday to take applications for disaster relief.
