Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the

coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story, "Oscar and Lucinda."
A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the $26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at London's ancient Guildhall.
Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won.
Carey called the award a "great honor" and he thanked the prize sponsors for "provoking so much passionate discussion about literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow."
