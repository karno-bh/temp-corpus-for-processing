The crippling drought hitting North America is

expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today.
If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.
As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said.
The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.
