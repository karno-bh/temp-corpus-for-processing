Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most

widely and deeply felt show-business loss in recent memory, was the movies' greatest gift to television.
She had had bit parts in two earlier films but "Roman Scandals" was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a Hollywood career.
She perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films, including three of Fred Astaire's and one of the Marx Brothers ("Room Service").
To look at the "I Love Lucy" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, is to realize how superbly professional they are.
