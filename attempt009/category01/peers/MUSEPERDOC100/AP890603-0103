Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early

Sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters in clashes that witnesses and doctors said killed at least 32 people.
"You have to give up all hope," students said over their loudspeaker at the monument.
"You have to give your life to the movement."
Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of the square as troops shot at crowds of thousands.
One soldier was killed when he was run over by an armored personnel carrier rushing toward the square, and another man was reported shot to death in a street clash elsewhere.
