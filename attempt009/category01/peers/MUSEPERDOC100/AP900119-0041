There was plenty of blame to go around at the

end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52 child molestation charges.
And some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody.
"The system is not going to protect children," said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didn't testify in the case.
"To have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally that I have some political motive is totally unjustified."
