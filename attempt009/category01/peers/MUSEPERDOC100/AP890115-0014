Deaths from heart and blood vessel

disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade, but it remains by far the nation's biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, the American Heart Association said Sunday.
"The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go."
The association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers.
Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food, and improved medical treatment.
Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
