Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to

collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran.
I have been in contact with a group that raised $150,000 (Saturday) by telephoning from home to home.
Irvine Police Sgt. Tom Hume, who is in charge of policing special events held in the city, said the group failed to obtain a permit from the city.
Her 17-year-old son, Homan, and his friend Sepehr Khonsari worked throughout the day Saturday collecting medical supplies from doctors' offices throughout the county.
