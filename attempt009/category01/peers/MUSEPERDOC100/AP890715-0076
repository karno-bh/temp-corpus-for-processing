Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real

estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated "unqualified" by the American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of state.
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee.
