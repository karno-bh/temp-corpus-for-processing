President Bush has decided to nominate John D. Negroponte, a veteran diplomat

who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday.
Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras.
Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which has not been formally announced.
State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not object formally.
