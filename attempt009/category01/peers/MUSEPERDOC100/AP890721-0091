Coal miners in Siberia ended their

strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued in other key coal regions.
In the Karaganda region of the southern republic of Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union's third-biggest coal-producing area, all 26 mines were at a standstill, and miners made more than 70 demands, Izvestia said.
"It's a victory over the system that we've had in the Soviet Union for the last 70 years, a system in which we work hard but get little in return," said Pyotr A. Menayev, an engineer at the Taldinski Severny open pit mine on the outskirts of Prokopyevsk.
