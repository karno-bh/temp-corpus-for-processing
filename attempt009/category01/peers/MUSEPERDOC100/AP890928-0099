It's taken the devastation caused by

Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.
The letter included nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through their crisis.
"This money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want," Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.
