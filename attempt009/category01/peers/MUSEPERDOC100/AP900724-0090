Indian frontier guards shot and killed 20

Moslem militants and arrested nine others after they sneaked into India-held Kashmir from Pakistan, a senior official said today.
The militants were killed late Monday at Kupwara, 56 miles north of Srinagar during gunbattle with Indian guards, said the Kashmir official, who cannot be identified under standing briefing regulations.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the porous border and return by the same route after reciving arms training in Pakistan.
The deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 863 since Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
