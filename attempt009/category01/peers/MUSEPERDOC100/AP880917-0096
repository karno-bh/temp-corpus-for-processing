Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a

river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140 miles inland from Matamoros.
Several buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more were feared drowned.
The Santa Catarina river crosses Monterrey.
The eye of 450-mile-wide hurricane, with 120 mph winds, crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT, sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area 120 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, weather reports said.
