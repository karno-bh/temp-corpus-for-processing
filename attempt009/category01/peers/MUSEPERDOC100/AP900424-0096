Seven years late, the Hubble Space

Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time.
Hawley's job on Wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
There the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
"It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years," said NASA administrator Richard Truly.
