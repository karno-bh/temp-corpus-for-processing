The "coup people," as President Bush dubbed them, could not havemiscalculated more profoundly. They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev,

and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.; But the people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created.
It seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.
One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's abysmal standing in the polls.
