President Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian

Gulf on Thanksgiving Day.
In the State Department, too, it came as a shock.
Thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday.
Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British and American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader Neville Chamberlain.
When George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in his praise.
Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow.
