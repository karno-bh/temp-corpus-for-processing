Walk.

Stay.
Roll over.
Go to court.
Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH.
Robin Crest Lorien Corniche.
Basically, his problem comes from serving more than one master.
One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old.
In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, "Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success . . . and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished."
