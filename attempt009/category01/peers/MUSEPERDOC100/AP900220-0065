Spike Lee may have been wearing a

Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from Academy Award voters.
In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Lee shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, "Do the Right Thing," and blamed it on generational politics.
The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best picture or best director.
Asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations, Lee replied, "Racism's involved in everything."
