Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was

supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight.
Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration.
Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and "recommended him very highly," the News reported.
