Pakistani and Indian troops

exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said.
They said there were no reports of casualties from today's firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.
The former princely state was divided between the two nations after British colonial rule ended in 1947.
Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched a military crackdown on Moslem separatists in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir.
In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian officers are no longer accompanying United Nations' military observers as they pass through the borders.
