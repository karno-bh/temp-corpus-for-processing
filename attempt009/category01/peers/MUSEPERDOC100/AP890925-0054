Residents took forecasters at their word

when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
"We just feel very thankful about that," said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. "Several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death."
Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation warnings.
Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000 residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters.
