John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her

successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
"I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party," Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.
