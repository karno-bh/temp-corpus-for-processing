Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its

reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces near the oil-rich kingdom's border.
Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the crown prince.
But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: "The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help."
