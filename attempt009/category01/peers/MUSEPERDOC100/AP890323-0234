The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this

community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon.
Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.
Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.
Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas metropolitan area, "It's not like 'Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out."
Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
