The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met

to implement the "final solution" against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification.
"I think that the place where they decided on the 'final solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day."
Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70 countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee, Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.
