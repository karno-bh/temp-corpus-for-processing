Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents

and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today alongside his wife.
Bernstein, who died of lung failure Sunday at age 72, was buried this afternoon in private ceremonies at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.
His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first American-born music director.
Bernstein was appointed in 1958 and stepped down in 1969 to spend more time composing.
A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14, the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
