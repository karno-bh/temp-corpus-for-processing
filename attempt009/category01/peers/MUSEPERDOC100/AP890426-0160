Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the

western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago.
But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world," said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month.
"She was always so full of life," said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
The American Heart Association's Jamestown office was deluged with calls from Miss Ball's fans who wanted to make a memorial donation, officials said.
"We just can't process as many memorials as we've received," said office manager Nathan Lax.
