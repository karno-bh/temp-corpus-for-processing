Defense Secretary-designate John Tower

contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday.
One newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were overlooked in the probe.
Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.
A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to comment on the latest reports, saying "it's (the nomination) before the committee."
