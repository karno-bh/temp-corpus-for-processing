The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob

a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.
But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice.
The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel.
Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a "blowback," which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed.
