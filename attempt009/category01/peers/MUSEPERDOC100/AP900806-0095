The U.N. Security Council today

overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait.
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans "the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution."
It was the third time in its 45-year existence that the world body had voted sanctions against a member state.
The last time was 1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive sanctions against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
