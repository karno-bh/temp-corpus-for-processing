The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose

Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday.
The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items.
Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadena's deputy city manager.
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the city's Board of Directors.
