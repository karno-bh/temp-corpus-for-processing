Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts

in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest, costliest criminal trial.
In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
However, the judge noted that "The attorneys are hopeful all the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts."
However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant.
