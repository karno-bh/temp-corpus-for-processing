The Soviet Union said today that a united

Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
The remarks, a copy of which were obtained by The Associated Press, indicates that a united Germany would be free to join the Western NATO alliance after a five-year transitional period.
Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the German armed forces and "to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations."
