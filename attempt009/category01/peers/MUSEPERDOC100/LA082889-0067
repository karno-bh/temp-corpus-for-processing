Dave Johnson of the United States clinched the decathlon gold medal in the

final event at the World University Games Sunday.
Johnson trailed Mikhail Medved of the Soviet Union by 11 points before the 1,500-meter race, the final event of the two-day competition.
"I felt good going into the race, but my legs just gave out," said Blockburger, who had the slowest 1,500 time and earned only 569 points in the final event.
Four of Romania's golds came in rowing and two in track and field, one of them from Olympic champion Paula Ivan, who set a meet record in winning the women's 3,000-meter race.
