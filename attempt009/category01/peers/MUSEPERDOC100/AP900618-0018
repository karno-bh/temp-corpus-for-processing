The death toll from flash floods that

swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks, and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags, where search dogs indicated they'd detected human scents, said National Guard Capt. Jim Boling.
Four bodies were found Sunday.
But two of those were not immediately identified, and the list of missing was not revised to account for them.
That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursday's floods to 20, including five children.
Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims, said Boling.
