East Germany authorities on Friday

interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-feared secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors, said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.
More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.
Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power.
