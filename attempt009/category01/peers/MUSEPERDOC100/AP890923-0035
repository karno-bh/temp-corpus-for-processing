The ``greenhouse effect'' may breed bigger and

deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.
Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measured at 940 millibars.
Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests the warming trend is already here.
The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.
