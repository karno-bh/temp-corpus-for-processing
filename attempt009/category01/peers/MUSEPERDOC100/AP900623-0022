Iran is deliberately underreporting the number

of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the country's Islamic leadership say.
"They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks."
As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.
"Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in Iran," Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated 3,000 people attending the rally.
