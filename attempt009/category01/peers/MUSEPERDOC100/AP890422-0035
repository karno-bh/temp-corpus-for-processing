Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47

sailors who died on the USS Iowa as victims of a tragedy that "reaches into little towns all over the country."
"Words are never sufficient at a time like this to express the feelings that we share," Norfolk Mayor Joseph Leafe told the more than 750 people who came to Friday's memorial at the Elizabeth River waterfront.
Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to a report in today's editions of The Washington Post.
