Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and

Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music center where he got his start.
The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000 each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festival's endowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.
"Because Tanglewood is so special for him and, conversely, he's so special to us, the combination will produce what we hope will be a unique event," she said.
Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will be among those performing highlights from "Fidelio" and other works to honor Bernstein's landmark opera recordings.
