The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked

by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month.
He postponed corporate tax reforms by a year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group.
To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains.
Overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries, arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).
