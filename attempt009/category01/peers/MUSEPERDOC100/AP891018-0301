Most San Francisco-area homeowners may

have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
Industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States earlier this month.
