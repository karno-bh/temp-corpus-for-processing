Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region

are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a sympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirle coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the horizon in the winter.
