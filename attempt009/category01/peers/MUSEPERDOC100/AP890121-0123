Grieving relatives and friends gathered

at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.
"Although there are some people in the United States who do bad things, most of the people in the United States do good things," said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School, where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher happened last Tuesday.
In time, some of the cutting edge of the pain will go away," Busher said.
During the morning, a Catholic funeral mass and burial were held for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees.
