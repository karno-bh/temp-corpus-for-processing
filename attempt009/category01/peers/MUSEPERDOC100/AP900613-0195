Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885

this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday.
No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
It was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government.
Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife _ mainly ethnic clashes _ in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested.
