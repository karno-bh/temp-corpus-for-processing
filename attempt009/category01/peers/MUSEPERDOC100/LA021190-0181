From behind bars, Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in

South Africa.
1944 Mandela joins the African National Congress at age 26, later becoming president of the group's Youth League.
In December, he is arrested and charged under Suppression of Communism Act.
He gets a suspended sentence and is barred from attending meetings or leaving Johannesburg.
In August he is charged with incitement and leaving the country illegally; gets five-year jail term.
January, 1985 President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence; Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and grants full political rights to blacks.
But South Africa bans all local celebrations.
