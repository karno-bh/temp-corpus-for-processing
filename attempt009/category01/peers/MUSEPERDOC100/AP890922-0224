Six novels have been nominated for the Booker

Prize, Britain's most prestigious fiction award, and bookmakers say the favorite is "The Remains of the Day" by Japanese author Kazuo Ishiguro.
The award, to be announced Oct. 26, carries a $31,600 prize funded by the Booker McConnell food company.
Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, "was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view," said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.
_ "A Disaffection," Scottish novelist James Kelman's story about a school teacher, Patrick Doyle, whose professional frustrations are fueled by a drinking problem and unrequited love for a colleague.
