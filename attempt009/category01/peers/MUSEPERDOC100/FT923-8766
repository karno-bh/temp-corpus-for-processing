TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one

of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held.
Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.
It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25'C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30'C.
The race was won by the Unified Team's Valentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in Los Angeles and Seoul.
