President Corazon Aquino of the

Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation European tour, met with West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other officials.
"We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor," she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
"We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars," she said.
