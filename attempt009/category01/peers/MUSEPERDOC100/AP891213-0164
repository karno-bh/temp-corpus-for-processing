The government has decided to give ethnic Germans

and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass reported Wednesday.
People can't just be expelled from the area for others to move in."
The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple.
