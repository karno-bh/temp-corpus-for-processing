said Jessie Daligdig, a government geologist.; Villagers tied wet kerchiefs on their faces and used rakes, shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket of snow-like ash from roads.
The mayor in San Marcelino, 17 miles southwest of the volcano, was giving a speech to several thousand people when dark clouds suddenly blotted the sun and turned day to night.; Calixto Macalma Jr., a police intelligence officer, said people panicked as it began "raining sand."
Church bells pealed in alarm, sirens wailed and many ran for shelter.; Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19,369 people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by late Wednesday.
