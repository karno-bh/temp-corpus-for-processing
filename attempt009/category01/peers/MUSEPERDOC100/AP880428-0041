New treatments that stop a heart attack in its

tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
They found that these people had no unusual complications, got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills.
Topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances _ tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, and angioplasty.
The report represents the latest in a steady three-decade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays.
However, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted.
