This historic city has survived the

ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
"This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced," warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
The worst in recent decades was in 1938 when a tornado tore through the city, killing 32 people, injuring hundreds and causing an estimated $2 million in property damage.
But the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of Aug. 31, 1886, when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to Judgement Day.
