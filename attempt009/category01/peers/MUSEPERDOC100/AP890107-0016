TOKYO (AP _ Emperor Hirohito will be remembered for one

overwhelming decision during his 62-year reign: Japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the Pacific conflict in World War II.
On Aug. 10, 1945, four days after history's first atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima and one day after a U.S. bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, the generals and admirals of Imperial Japan's wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the Tokyo palace.
Then, evoking a memory of his grandfather, the Emperor Meiji, whose reign (1867-1912) saw the end of 250 years of feudal Japanese isolation from the outside world, Hirohito told the officers: "The time has come when we must bear the unbearable."
