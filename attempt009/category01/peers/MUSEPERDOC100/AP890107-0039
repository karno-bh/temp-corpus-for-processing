World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned

today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic pre-eminence.
While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, a government party statement added, "We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan relationship."
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said: "Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohito's death.
