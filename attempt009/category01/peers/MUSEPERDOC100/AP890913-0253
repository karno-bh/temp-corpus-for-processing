Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the

jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called "G.I. Journal."
A secretary dug the details of that first joint appearance out of one of two vaults where Hope keeps everything pertaining to his long comic career.
"Lucy was in the hospital and I saw her daughter, Lucie Arnaz, and said, 'Isn't it wonderful she's doing better.'
"I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage," Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special.
