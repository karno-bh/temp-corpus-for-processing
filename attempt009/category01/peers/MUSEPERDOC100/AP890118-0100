Four imprisoned African

National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas.
Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband last month that he is being held "practically in solitary confinement" at the house.
The four men who visited Mandela are Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mhlangeni, Raymond Mhlaba and Ahmed Kathrada.
