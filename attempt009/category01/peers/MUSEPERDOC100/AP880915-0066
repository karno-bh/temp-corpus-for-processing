A biography that portrays John Lennon as a

drug-addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is "totally fiction," Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.
The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman's "The Lives of John Lennon," which presents the ex-Beatle as a violent, drug-addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartney's 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
