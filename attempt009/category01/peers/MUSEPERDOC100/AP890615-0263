Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton

pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash registers.
The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world's richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started hand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills could be tallied on calculators quickly.
"People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him," said store manager Paul Sively.
Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.
