Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San

Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years.
The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018.
Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in Southern California sometime in the next three decades.
