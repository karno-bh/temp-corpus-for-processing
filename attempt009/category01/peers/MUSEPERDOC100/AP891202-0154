Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured

visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
"He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified Germany be neutral," Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the American delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.
Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to staying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, the Indiana Republican said: "Without any reservations."
There has been speculation that West Germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the Kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.
