Ferries are among the safest vessels afloat. But, as the tragic sinking of

the Estonia with the loss of more than 800 lives demonstrates, when they do go down the toll in human life can be high.
The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ship's side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
Higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares - unwelcome to ferry operators when, on the short cross-Channel routes, they face competition from the Channel tunnel.
