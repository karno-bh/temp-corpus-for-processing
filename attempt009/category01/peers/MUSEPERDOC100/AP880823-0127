Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday

to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday, while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
Other helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state.
