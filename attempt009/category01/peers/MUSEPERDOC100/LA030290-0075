Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening," which it

surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now.
With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians, it's no wonder that in only five years the L. A. Marathon has become the best-marketed, slickest, most modern and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
And that may yet transform this race, if -- as marathon President Bill Burke said this week -- the total purse of $202,520 is increased by $100,000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes.
