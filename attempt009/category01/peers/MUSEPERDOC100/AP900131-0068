West German officials and media today praised

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened East Germans.
Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but he added that Germans "should not decide this important question on the streets."
Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject of a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for more than 40 years.
Communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for March 18 parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their "European concept" that aims for a united and demilitarized Europe.
