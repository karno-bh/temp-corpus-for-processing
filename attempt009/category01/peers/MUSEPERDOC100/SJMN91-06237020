Yeltsin, the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week'smilitary coup, has drastically tipped the balance of power here, showing

himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev.
Gorbachev struggled to explain his own position, but he seemed at a loss.; Yeltsin, who clearly relished his emotional and political control of the parliament session, also played a critical role in selecting the new heads of the KGB, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry police, which until now have been bastions of opposition to reform.
Flouting protocol, Yeltsin was the first to announce the appointments while speaking at a mass rally Friday morning outside KGB headquarters.; New appointees; Former Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin will head the KGB, Gen. Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the air force chief, becomes defense minister and former Russian Interior Minister Victor Barannikov will be the union's interior minister.
