President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in

the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders.
However, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed al Mashat, said Iraq had invaded Kuwait in response to a request from the nation's "interim free government."
Despite Bush's refusal to rule out military action, it appeared an unlikely option given the strength of Iraq's military, the limited U.S. forces in the region and the opposition to U.S. intervention from other countries in the area.
