Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all

receded along Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang except at a section of the Xijiang River in Wuzhou city, Guangxi, a spokesman from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters announced today.
The spokesman attributed the falling water level to the major water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses.
Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August.
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
