Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait,

has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his crown prince.
But on Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call: "The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help."
Turkey also has refused to comment about President Bush's suggestion that Turkey cut off Iraq's oil pipeline to the Mediterranean.
