A drug used to treat patients complaining

of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients, according to a study published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
But the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack.
