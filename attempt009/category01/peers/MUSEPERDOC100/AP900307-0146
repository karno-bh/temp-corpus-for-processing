Moslems blew up a truck carrying security

forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, officials said.
Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state.
An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally.
At least 171 people have been killed in Kashmir since a government crackdown on the separatist movement began on Jan. 20.
