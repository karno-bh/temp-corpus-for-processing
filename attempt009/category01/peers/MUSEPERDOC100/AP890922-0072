Amid the uproar of live coverage by the

major networks and scores of other media organizations, National Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring Hurricane Hugo.
On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas.
On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and tidbits of his expertise.
Surrounded by cameras, wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.
