GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance

claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.'
Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accident advise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.
Mr Nelson Robertson, GA's chief general manager, explained later that the company has a 1/2 per cent share of the Florida market.
