The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys

support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
"No one really wants German unity except the East German people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor," says Hyland, a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
"Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom," he said.
