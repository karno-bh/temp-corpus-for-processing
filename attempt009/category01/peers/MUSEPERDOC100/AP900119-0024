A therapist defended her interviews of

alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecution's case.
Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution.
Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently, including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time.
