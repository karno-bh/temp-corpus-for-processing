Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest

storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.
Despite the intensity of the onslaught and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor injuries.
The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday.
The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the nation's 2.3 million people were homeless.
