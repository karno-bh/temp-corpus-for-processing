The Hubble Space Telescope was

awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been in a "safe mode" with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
