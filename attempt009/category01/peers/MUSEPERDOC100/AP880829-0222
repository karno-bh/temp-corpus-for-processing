Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks

earlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.
The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.
Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers found.
The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite their proven success.
