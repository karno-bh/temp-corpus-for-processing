Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the

Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets.
Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
"There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally 'Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote," said the judges.
Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work, has published five novels since 1964.
