The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where

about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5.
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.
Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.
