Former East German leader Erich

Honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens, a newspaper said Wednesday.
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
In December, seven former Politburo members were arrested, and Honecker was placed under house arrest in the government housing area of Wandlitz outside East Berlin.
It was the churches that became the venues for gathering of pro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his 18-year leadership.
