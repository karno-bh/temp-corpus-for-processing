Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indiana

senator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.
Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life.
Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period.
Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
