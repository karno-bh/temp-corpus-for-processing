The damaged battleship USS Iowa steamed home

from Puerto Rico on Friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed 47 sailors.
Ens. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy would not release the exact position of the ship, which was expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said Lt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman.
