Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry

captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded with New Year's travelers, sank off the Caribbean coast.
Juan Pablo Ezquibel was arrested after authorities determined that about 120 people were aboard the 30-ton ferry, which was authorized to carry 90, said Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, second-in-command at the Puerto Barrios naval base.
He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
