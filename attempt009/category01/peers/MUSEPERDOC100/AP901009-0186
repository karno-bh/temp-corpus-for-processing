John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was

delivered Tuesday as his song "Imagine" was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
"A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is reality.
When asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies, he said: "If he had been alive I doubt he would have come and even if he had, he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh."
On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near Lennon's star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the "Imagine" broadcast: "Imagine all the people, living life in peace "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one "I hope some day you'll join us "And the world will live as one."
