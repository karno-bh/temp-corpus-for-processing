Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose

harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery.
The actress, star of the hugely popular "I Love Lucy" and related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had undergone major heart surgery April 18.
"But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with us on television and we can see her on and on."
Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in "I Love Lucy" from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in widely syndicated reruns.
