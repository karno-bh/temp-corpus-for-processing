Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have

On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
Baghdad's only other major pipelines exporting crude run through Saudi Arabia, where the flow has been drastically reduced.
The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the two countries export their goods.
Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August, he said, but "we are already in the process of taking steps to secure alternative sources ..." The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy.
