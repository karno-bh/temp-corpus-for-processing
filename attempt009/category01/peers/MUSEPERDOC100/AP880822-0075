Rescuers searched through debris today

for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one-third of this country's territory and parts of India, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands.
The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawn quake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years.
Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, told a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured.
Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims.
