A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill

communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today.
"It created a wall of water," said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
"The problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find."
Gov. Richard F. Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed the area.
The raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in Shadyside, an Appalachian foothill town.
Belmont County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall.
