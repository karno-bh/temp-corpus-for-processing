The shuttle that put the Hubble Space

Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the world's most powerful telescope.
"It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy," astronaut Kathy Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle Discovery.
After she brings the eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the observatory.
"This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy," the institute said.
