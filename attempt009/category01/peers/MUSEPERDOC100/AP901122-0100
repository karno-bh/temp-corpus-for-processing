Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's international

admirers praised her courage and achievements Thursday after she announced she would resign.
Vitaly Ignatenko, spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, told the independent Interfax news agency: "Political, economic and cultural ties between our countries have become of greater importance" in the Thatcher era.
Bitterness was undisguised in the comment from Argentina's Nicanor Costa Mendez, foreign minister during his country's 1982 Falklands War with Britain.
"I believe that the extreme positions - unnecessarily extreme, unjustifiably extreme - of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war, and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after."
