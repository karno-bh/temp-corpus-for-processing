Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a

whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today.
CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout.
But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago.
This also marks only the third time that the network airing the Super Bowl did not win the week -- NBC managed it in 1979 and 1981.
