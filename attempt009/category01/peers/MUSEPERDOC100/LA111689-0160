A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school

Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many others in their cars and homes, police said.
"Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas," said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in this northeastern Alabama city.
Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College, which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in scattered areas.
The fifth death was reported near the shopping district.
