The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test,

which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new "risk factor" for heart attacks.
The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.
"In our hands, it cost about $40 and in other labs it may cost the patient $40 to $80," he said.
Dr. Laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test, which was developed by his wife, biochemist Jean E. Sealey.
