The expensive practice of using balloon

catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival.
At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.
If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure.
