The drought may force the government to ease

crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Monday.
But the United States "will continue to be a major player" in world agriculture and in 1989 "should be able to bounce back" from this year's drought losses, he said.
In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more than 50 percent was in that category.
"Because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s," Lyng said.
