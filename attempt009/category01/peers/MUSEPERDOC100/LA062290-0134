Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake

that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.
An estimated 1 million Iranians were killed or wounded in the eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988.
Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces.
While IRNA reported 10,000 dead late Thursday, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations said 25,000 people had died.
