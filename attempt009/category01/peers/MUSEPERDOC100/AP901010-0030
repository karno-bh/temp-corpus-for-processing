Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side

Story" composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion and physical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because of poor health.
Albert K. Webster, managing director of the Philharmonic, said: "Leonard Bernstein has BEEN the New York Philharmonic for more than 45 years.
Bernstein still hopes to participate in an AIDS benefit at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28 but canceled all appearances with orchestras in New York, Israel, Vienna and London and with festival orchestras at Tanglewood, Germany and Japan.
In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing "a near brush with pneumonia."
