A major earthquake rocked northern

California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95 miles away.
There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported.
The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
The preliminary reading was from the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said.
Players from the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave their seats.
