Television watchers of the 19th annual New York

City Marathon followed the step-by-step progress Sunday of the leaders, but many spectators on the course scanned the thousands of runners for a familar face.
The winner in the field of 23,478 _ largest ever for a marathon _ was Steve Jones of Wales, who finished in 2 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds, only seven seconds off the course record.
Marybeth Torpe was hoping another runner would run fast _ her boyfriend Tony Giannelli.
"Mr. Paciorkowski told us if he saw a television camera, he'd wave to us," Avery said _ as she held a small portable television in her hand.
