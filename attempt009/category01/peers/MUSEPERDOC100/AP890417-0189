Two sailors were missing Monday evening after a

652-foot freighter en route from Greece apparently sank in rough seas 400 miles southeast of Cape Cod.
Twenty-three crew members were rescued.
The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said.
The Ravenscraig's crew spotted a second life raft, but it turned out to be empty.
A Coast Guard jet from the air station on Cape Cod and a C-130 plane from Elizabeth City, N.C., converged on the ship.
