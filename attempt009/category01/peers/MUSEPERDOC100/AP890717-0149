The largest family group to visit

black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday.
Mrs. Mandela, referring to her earlier visit with her husband, told reporters: "He said from that meeting with P.W. Botha we musn't construe as indicating his release.
She said the family normally spent Mandela's birthday at home, fasting and praying, but members would visit him this year on his birthday "because he has invited us to come and share it with him."
