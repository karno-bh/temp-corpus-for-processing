The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the

1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority, picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for "humanitarian contributions in the race of life."
President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend.
Bush called Owens, who was black, an "Olympic hero and an American hero every day of his life ... born with the gift of burning speed."
At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold medals _ in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 400-meter relay.
