Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the

new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on untruths.
Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on 1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
"All I know and all the people that love John know that we had our years (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever complete what went on in our lives.
Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book on the radio taping, calling it "lies, untruths," and adding that "the whole thing is just sickening."
