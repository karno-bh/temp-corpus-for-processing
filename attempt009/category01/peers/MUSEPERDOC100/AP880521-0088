Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath

the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822.
The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert.
Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung Western European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.
The French painter Eugene Delacroix produced a famous picture, "The Massacre of Chios," based on the raids.
