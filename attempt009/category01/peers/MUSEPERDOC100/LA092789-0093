The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday

that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
"Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston.
Although the losses are substantial, they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs.
For example, Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages.
