And for the sentimentalists, there will be 83-year-old Johnny Kelleystarting in his 60th Boston Marathon. There have only been 35 editions of this

race run without him.; The last three Boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels.
Neither won.; The winner was 1988 Olympic champion Gelindo Bordin, who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient, calculating race.; Running alone about 200 meters behind a pack of six Africans, Bordin passed them all by 21 miles and went on to win in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 19 seconds, the second-fastest time in the race's history, behind only the 2:07:51 by Rob de Castella in 1986.; Ikangaa finished a distant second in 2:09:52.
