TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian

enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States' defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
