Communism suffered its first Big Mac

attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches.
It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination.
Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding.
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.
