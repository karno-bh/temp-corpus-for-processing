A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest

blew north Thursday, knocking a cafeteria wall down on top of lunching schoolchildren in upstate New York.
The cafeteria cave-in claimed the lives of seven children near Newburgh, N.Y., and deaths also were reported in New York City, New Jersey and Illinois.
Seventeen people died Wednesday in Huntsville, Ala., when a tornado packing 250 mph winds struck virtually without warning, laying waste to a wide swath of the city.
By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday.
