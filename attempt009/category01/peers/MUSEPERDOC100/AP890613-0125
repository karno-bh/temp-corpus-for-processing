A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk

with great fanfare to commemorate the "Voyage of the Damned" was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday.
It was sunk June 4, 50 years after the U.S. Coast Guard turned away the SS St. Louis as its more than 900 Jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the Holocaust.
The sinking site was supposed to be near where the Coast Guard intercepted the St. Louis, whose passengers also were turned away by Cuba and forced to return to Europe.
"They didn't even come close," complained Susan Markely, an administrator with Dade's environmental department.
