For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was

regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies.
Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in 1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya.
There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that seemed out of step with the times.
Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left office, the president said he was leaving the White House with "considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street."
