Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the

United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance.
The U.S. government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the Red Cross and other donor groups.
Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably was delivered through a third party but added that he was uncertain.
Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq -- but excluded Israel and South Africa.
