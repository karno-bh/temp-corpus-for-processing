INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed

two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores of others.
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.
In what many interpreted as a reference to Pakistan, with whom India has fought three wars, last week Mr Shankarrao Chavan, the federal home (interior) minister, told parliament in New Delhi that he suspected 'an international conspiracy.'
