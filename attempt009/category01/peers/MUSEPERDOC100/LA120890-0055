Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted

Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet, which is a hereditary knighthood.
Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queen's desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent women.
"This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didn't like each other," said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
