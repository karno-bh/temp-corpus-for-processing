After years of delay and a

last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
Mission specialist Steven Hawley released Hubble from the end of the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescope's solar wings unfurled.
"The first of NASA's great observatories is now on station at 330 nautical miles above the Earth," Mission Control's Jeffrey Carr said.
"The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and we sure hope it does good work," Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver said later.
