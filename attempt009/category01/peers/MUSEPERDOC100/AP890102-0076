A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean

coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are missing, authorities and news reports said today.
Gaytan said the boat sank while it was being towed by a tugboat.
The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City confirmed the sinking and said a 40-year-old Spanish citizen, Vicente Daudi, was among the dead.
The embassy reported his wife, Rosa Maria Arnal, and a son survived the shipwreck, but two daughters were missing.
Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic development mission in Guatemala, the embassy said.
