The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was

observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem "Imagine" was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130 nations.
The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150 people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby.
"Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual, human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom and peace," said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's leading popular music publication.
