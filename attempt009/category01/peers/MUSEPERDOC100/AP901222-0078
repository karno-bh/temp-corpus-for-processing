Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls

waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the USS Saratoga and joking, "Whoa, looks like we're flooding."
At least 19 sailors drowned, and scores were injured.
Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed at Haifa's Rambam Hospital.
Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big wave.
Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had cracked his joke.
"And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over."
