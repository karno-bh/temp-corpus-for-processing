President Corazon Aquino on Friday

refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government won't permit him to be buried here despite "a last appeal" from his wife.
Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland, and his supporters threatened mass protests if the request is rejected.
But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and the Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former president's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return.
