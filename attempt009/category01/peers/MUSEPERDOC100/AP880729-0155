Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher

legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying "nationalist passions" benefit opponents of his reforms.
State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985.
He indicated Friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis.
