Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is

on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving.
While praising the new course in world affairs taken by the Soviet Union, as demonstrated by its withdrawal from Afghanistan, Sakharov told the congress of the Italian Socialist Party that some aspects of internal affairs are "deeply disturbing."
"We all know about the serious economic situation which can only get worse.
Economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and people are losing interest in them because they can't buy anything.
"The old centralized system is being dismantled, and that is right.
