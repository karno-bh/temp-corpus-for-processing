John Major, endorsed by Margaret Thatcher as the

politician closest to her heart, was elected by the Conservative Party Tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister.
Major, the chancellor of the exchequer, emerged from his official residence at 11 Downing St. Tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife, Norma.
Inside, Mrs. Thatcher, who came next door from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street residence, embraced Major.
Howe, the fourth Cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the European Community, shocked the House of Commons on Nov. 13 by calling Mrs. Thatcher a threat to Britain's vital interests.
