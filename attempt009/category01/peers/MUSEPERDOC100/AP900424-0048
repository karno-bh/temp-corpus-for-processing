today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
I can't say what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn many new things."
Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986 just before the Challenger explosion.
