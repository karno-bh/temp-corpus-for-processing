Well, it did turn out to be "Rain Man's" evening, but not until the last few

minutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night's Academy Awards results, it's that parity has returned to Hollywood.
"Rain Man" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and "Mississippi Burning," with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling.
But gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many recent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving people out of the Oscar resale market.
"Rain Man," its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters (the two of several who worked on it) may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but there were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form.
