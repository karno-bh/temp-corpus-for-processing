Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror,

with sales of three million copies daily.
In other changes, Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who has been appointed deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign from his post at Maxwell Communication, where he was joint deputy managing director.
Maxwell Communication said last month that its management would be taken over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's brother.
Through staff cuts and heavy spending on printing facilities, Mr. Maxwell built Mirror into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper groups.
In 1990, Mirror had profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2 pence a share, on revenue of #445 million.
