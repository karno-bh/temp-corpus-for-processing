The Discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the $1.5-billion Hubble Space

Telescope one orbit late today after last-ditch commands from Earth freed a stuck solar panel, narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk.
"Discovery, go for Hubble release," Mission Control told the crew at 12:37 p.m. PDT.
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescope's instruments.
Mission Control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help.
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.
