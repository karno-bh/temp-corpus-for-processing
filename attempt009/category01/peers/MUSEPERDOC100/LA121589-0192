World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today

praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout Eastern Europe.
The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by Kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom.
"It's a great loss," Gorbachev said.
"He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly.
This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on many things we did agree."
