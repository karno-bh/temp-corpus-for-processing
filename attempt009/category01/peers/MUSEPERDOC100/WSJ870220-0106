A crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here March 1 to run 26 miles, 385 yards.

And cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees.
With those numbers in mind, the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons -- in New York, Boston and Los Angeles -- as well as other running races.
The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city.
The event also pulled in about $4 million in cash and services from its sponsors, leaving the organizers with $370,000 in red ink.
Marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors.
