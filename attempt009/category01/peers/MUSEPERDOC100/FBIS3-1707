Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President

Bill Clinton, trying to brush aside recent differences with London, today stressed Washington's special transatlantic relationship with Britain.
Welcoming British Prime Minister John Major in Pittsburgh, where major's grandfather and father once lived, Clinton said at the airport, "We're working together today to respond to the terrible tragedy in Bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading."
On Russia, Major said "A Russia that's a good neighbor to the United States and West would be one of the finest things that this generation could hand down to the next."
