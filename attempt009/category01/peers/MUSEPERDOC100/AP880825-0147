The parents of a Peace Corps worker

learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in that country and neighboring India.
"They called this morning, that's the first we had heard about anything since the quake," said Arthur Giaquinta, whose 24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the hard-hit Dharan Bazar township.
In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was safe.
