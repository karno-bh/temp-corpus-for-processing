Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament

and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago.
Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called "Lucona" scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.
Interior Minister Karl Blecha, like Gratz a onetime protege of former Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, resigned Jan.19.
"If it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic, then he cannot serve the National Council (parliament) in such a way as is his duty."
