Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud

houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid.
At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry.
In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the quake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick and mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10 were still living in it.
The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
