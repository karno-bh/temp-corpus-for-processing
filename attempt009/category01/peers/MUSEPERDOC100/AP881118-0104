Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the

two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace official was quoted as saying Friday.
The 87-year-old emperor's condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper intestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine days.
He added that doctors sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66 pounds.
