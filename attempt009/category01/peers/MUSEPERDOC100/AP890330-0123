Spencer Tracy's acting technique was simply

"less is better," and that helped make him the screen's greatest actor.
The Tracy credo is recommended to future producers of Academy Award shows.

The use of "couples, co-stars, compadres and companions," as presenters for the 61st Academy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium was clever but wearing.
The best Oscar shows have been emceed by Will Rogers, Bob Hope, Johnny Carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity.
Tom Selleck remarked that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. handed out the first awards in 1929 in five minutes.
