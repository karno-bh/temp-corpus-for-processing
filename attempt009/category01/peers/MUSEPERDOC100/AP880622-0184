and Phyllis Newman are among performers who will sing, act and make guest appearances at a birthday bash in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein.
The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a benefit concert scheduled for the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise money for the Tanglewood Music Center, where Bernstein got his conducting start.
Sills will be host.
Performances will include the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus under the direction of some of the many conductors whose careers have been guided by Bernstein.
Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will be among those performing highlights from "Fidelio," "Tristan und Isolde" and other works to honor Bernstein's landmark opera recordings.
