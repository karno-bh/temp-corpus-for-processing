The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers,

"thugs," bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing.
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded.
Non-official sources say Yuan's figures on civilian casualties are far too low, but most have different estimates on the number of victims.
In Washington, U.S. intelligence reports indicate 3,000 people probably were killed, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
