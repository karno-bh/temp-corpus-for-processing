re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennas.
An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
"We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system," Drachlis reported.
The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground.
Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem, Boggess said.
