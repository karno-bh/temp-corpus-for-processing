President Bush has named career diplomat Deane

Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as president.
Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is not in session.
The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with Panama.
He was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from 1979 to 1981, and before that U.S. representative to the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a State Department adviser on economic affairs, and director and economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic Development in Chile and in Guatemala.
