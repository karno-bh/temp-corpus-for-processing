Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee

Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and Xiangtan yesterday.
He inspected the flooded areas, including Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief work was in full swing.
Regarding the work in the next stage, he pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural production.
He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and embankments.
