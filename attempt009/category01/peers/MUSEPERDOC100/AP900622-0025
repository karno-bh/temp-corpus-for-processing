The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought

reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Like Thursday's earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
"It's very similar to what we had in Armenia," said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
