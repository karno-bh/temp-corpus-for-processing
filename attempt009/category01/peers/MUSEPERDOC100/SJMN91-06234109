In the United States, President Bush said he spoke to Gorbachev and theSoviet leader was "calling the shots" again. Bush said the hard-line coup

leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings."
"I'm sorry, comrades, but I'm very excited!"
Latvia joined neighbor Estonia today in declaring immediate independence from the Soviet Union.; The coup's failure could deal a fatal blow to organized, high-level efforts to thwart reform drives in the Soviet Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized Soviet power for the six-year Gorbachev era.; The country's future course depends, however, on who remains in power.
