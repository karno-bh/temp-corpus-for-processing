Thunderstorms swept through central and

eastern Ohio, causing flooding that killed at least ten people, left dozens missing and forced hundreds of others from their homes, officials said today.
Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 people overflowed when about 4 inches of rain fell Thursday night in about an hour.
Gov. Richard Celeste declared a state of emergency and surveyed the area.
Temporary morgues were set up at Bellaire City Hospital and a funeral home in Shadyside.
About 200 residents were evacuated from their homes in central Ohio after 3 inches of rain fell in an hour, flooding streets and washing out rural roads.
