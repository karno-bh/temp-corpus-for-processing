The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of

the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in London's ancient Guildhall.
The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business.
"The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular," said Shaw.
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers' Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
