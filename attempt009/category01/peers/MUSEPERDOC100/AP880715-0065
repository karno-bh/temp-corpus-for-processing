Public interest in the Earth's troubled

climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current U.S. drought, weather experts warned during a drought symposium here.
Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warming of the Earth's atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought.
However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that "make sense in their own right."
Some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries, for example drying out the U.S. Midwest or melting polar ice caps.
