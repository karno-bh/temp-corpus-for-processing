HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US

history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.
Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land.
The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut.
