Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a

traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.
But Moscow News asked: "Can he really do everything?"
Although the full-page article was the longest on Sakharov to date in the Soviet press, it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the Kremlin's intervention in Afghanistan.
The human rights activist, one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 1970s, sought openness in Soviet society years before "glasnost" became Communist Party policy.
