Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said.
Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside Westminster Abbey.
Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain with Gorbachev at her side, Thatcher told reporters: "The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues."
