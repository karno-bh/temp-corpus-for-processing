The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military

leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents.
He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors."
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries.
