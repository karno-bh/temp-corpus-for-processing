Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and hisacting defense minister, and named a new head of the KGB. And Yeltsin, with

Gorbachev's blessing, fired the heads of state-owned media.; The Moscow City Council, meanwhile, ordered all Communist Party buildings in the capital sealed and all telephone service to party and KGB buildings cut.
Some of the many new decrees issued by Yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as Russian Federation president.; In his speech before the Russian parliament, Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin during the three-day coup.
It wasn't clear whether the Soviet president had intended to back Yeltsin's latest decrees, and he balked at proposals by Russian deputies to outlaw the Communist Party, saying it would divide the nation.; Gorbachev told the deputies that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover.
