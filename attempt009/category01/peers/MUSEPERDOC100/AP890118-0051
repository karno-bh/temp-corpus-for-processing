Children whose families escaped the

horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word "victory."
Two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom, but also died.
... I was scared," said sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire.
Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death.
The word "victory" was written on the pistol handle.
