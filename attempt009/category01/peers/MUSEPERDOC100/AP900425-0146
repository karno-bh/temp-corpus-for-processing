Discovery's astronauts overcame

balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
The $1.5 billion telescope began orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12{-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries.
Astronauts Kathryn Sullivan and Bruce McCandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed.
