Trucks carried aid into earthquake-stricken Iran on Saturday from Soviet

Azerbaijan, which observed a day of mourning for victims, the official Tass news agency said.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent his condolences to the Iranian leadership, and the Soviet Red Cross dispatched a plane carrying rescue workers and aid.
A report by Tass from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku said an official day of mourning was declared in the mainly Muslim republic and that black ribbons hung from public buildings in the city.
Tass said people in Azerbaijan, many of whom are Shiite Muslims who feel a kinship with people of their faith in Iran, poured money into a public fund for earthquake victims.
