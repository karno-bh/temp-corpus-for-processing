Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being

old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'.
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe.
