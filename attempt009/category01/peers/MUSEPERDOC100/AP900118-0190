Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation

case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.
Jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children.
Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.
But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what their parents had told them.
"One child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to CII," Mrs. Williams recalled.
