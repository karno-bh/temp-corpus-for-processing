COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform

rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month.
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy.
The region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity, could also be run using lignite and gas.
