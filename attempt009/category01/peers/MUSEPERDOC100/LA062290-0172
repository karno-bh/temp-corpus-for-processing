Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War,

was hoisted into history today.
As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
"The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer Charlie's exit, snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away.
