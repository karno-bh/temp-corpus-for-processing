Although they are a continent apart, the cities of Charleston, S.C., and San

Francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time.
"From the standpoint of compassion, of all the people in America we can feel the hurt that the San Francisco area is going through the most," Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Sunday, one month after Hugo hit.
Hugo, 500 miles across with winds topping 175 m.p.h., left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and 80% of the city's buildings with some degree of damage.
Five days after the storm, many city residents remained inconvenienced, most without electricity, many without safe drinking water.
