John Lennon spent much of a three-year span

tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain Beatle.
The book is scheduled to be published later this month by William Morrow &amp; Co.
Inc.
Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, Sean, "Lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent."
The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection.
