Lucille Ball, the leggy showgirl, model and B-grade movie queen whose

pumpkin-colored hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television's early years, died early today, a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery.
The high-spirited star of "I Love Lucy," a show that the nation took to its heart as no other and that continues in syndication around the world, died of a ruptured abdominal aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said.
But the show, Miss Ball's first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings.
