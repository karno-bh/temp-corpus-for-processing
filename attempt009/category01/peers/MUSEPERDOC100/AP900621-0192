Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border

crossing by the Berlin Wall, was to be hauled away Friday.
U.S. Army Sgt. Lorn Walsh late Thursday stood sentry for the last time by the little white shack, rendered unnecessary by the thaw in East-West relations.
"This is a nice way to end my military service ... to be here when they take it down," said Walsh, 23, a military police officer who leaves the army in six weeks to study for the priesthood.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal Friday.
