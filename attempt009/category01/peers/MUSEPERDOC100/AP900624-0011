An anti-American newspaper in Iran said

Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.
The "criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident once again in the recent earthquake," the Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
"Our people, even under the rubble, chant 'Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even those hands stretched out to help," it said.
"Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots, halted the renovation of the country," the editorial added.
