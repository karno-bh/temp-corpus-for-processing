Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885

Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7.
Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife _ mainly ethnic clashes _ in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested.
He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said.
Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded.
