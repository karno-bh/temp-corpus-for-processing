Guangzhou, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The highest flood

peaks on the Xijiang and Beijiang Rivers have passed, said Zhu Senlin, governor of south China's Guangdong Province.
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Qingyuan city on the Beijiang River yesterday, he attributed Guangdong's success in combating this flood -- almost the biggest in 100 years -- to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in Guangdong and local residents.
Local governments at various levels in the province have paid close attention to flood control work, and leading government and communist party officials of different localities have gone to the flood-fighting front.
But the losses caused by the flood were quite serious, said the governor.
