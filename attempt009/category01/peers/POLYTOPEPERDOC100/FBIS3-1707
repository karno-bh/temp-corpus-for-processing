Washington, February 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President

On Russia, Major said "A Russia that's a good neighbor to the United States and West would be one of the finest things that this generation could hand down to the next."
Major will spend a night at the White House, the first foreign head of state to have this honor since Clinton became President.
On Tuesday [1 March], the two leaders will begin their discussions on a wide range of issues including Russia, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and the world trade.
The two will also discuss Northern Ireland and "what to do with NATO," Clinton said.
Major said Clinton would visit Britain, and perhaps the Oxford University, Clinton's alma mater, during the June visit.
