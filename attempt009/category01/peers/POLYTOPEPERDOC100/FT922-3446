DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his

son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have been obtained by the Financial Times.
Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.
