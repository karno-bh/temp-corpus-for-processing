The U.N. Security Council today

overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq, including a ban on oil purchases, to punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait.
It said Iraq had launched an armed attack against Kuwait and usurped the authority of Kuwait's legitimate government.
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take "punishing measures" against it or Iraq.
The council threatened to impose sanctions if Iraq did not comply.
The 10 non-permanent members are: Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.
