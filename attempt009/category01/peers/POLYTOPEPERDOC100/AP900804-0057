Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait,

has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
It did not condemn Thursday's invasion.
It broadcast calls for resistance to the Iraqis.
Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
The Saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied for economic and security cooperation with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
But there was no talk of specific action against Iraq by Kuwait's partners.
