A dozen of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa

As Navy officials continued their inquiry into the explosion, sailors aboard the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, opened their ship Saturday in Norfolk, Va., to talk about their pride in battleships and the sense of loss.
With only four battleships in the Navy, many aboard the Iowa once served on the Wisconsin.
'Face Same Dangers' "These are all old ships," said Lt. Matt Schatzle, 25, of Gulfport, Miss., who commands the three 16-inch guns of the Wisconsin's turret No. 3.
They do the same jobs, they face the same dangers."
