Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed

launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission.
Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today.
Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch the telescope Wednesday.
