Unidentified assailants hurled

a grenade and fired shots today at the home of relatives of Nelson Mandela, killing a baby girl and injuring her parents, police said.
Police said they did not know who was responsible for the attack.
ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of Mandela's father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela.
The ANC officials said Nelson Mandela was close to the Monde Mandela family.
An ANC statement said, "The ANC notes the curious coincidence of an attack on a man bearing the Mandela name at this time."
The police have denied Mandela's charges.
