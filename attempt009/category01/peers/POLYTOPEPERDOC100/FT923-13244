RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic

fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists.
South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin.
