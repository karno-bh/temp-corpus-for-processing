The following is a recorded report filed by this

station's reporter on the front lines of the province's battle against the flooding yesterday.
This morning, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Wang Maolin, provincial Governor Chen Bangzhu, and some other provincial party and government leaders arrived here in Changshayuan, on the front line of the province's flood resistance effort, to direct the fight against the flooding.
As soon as they stepped out from the train, they set out for Changshayuan, the front line of the province's flood resistance.
I interviewed Governor Chen Bangzhu here on the spot.
At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high.
