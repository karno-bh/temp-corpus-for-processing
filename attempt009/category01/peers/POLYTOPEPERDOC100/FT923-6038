HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US

Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said.
In north Miami, damage is minimal.
