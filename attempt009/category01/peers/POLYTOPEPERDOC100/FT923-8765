TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the

four relay finals.
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa).
The Dutch, with one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South America (nil) combined.
Lewis will be difficult to suppress tonight.
