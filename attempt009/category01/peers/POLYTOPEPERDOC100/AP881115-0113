The expensive practice of using balloon

The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.
A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.
Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle.
To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms.
