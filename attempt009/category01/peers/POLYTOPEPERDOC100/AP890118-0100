Four imprisoned African

National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas.
The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the same trial in 1964.
All were given life sentences for their activities with the ANC, the main guerrilla group attempting to overthrow the white-led government.
