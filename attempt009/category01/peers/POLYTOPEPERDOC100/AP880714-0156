Weather experts discussed the drought

John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane season.
He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable, depending on the intensity and speed of the storm.
Nevertheless, he said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
