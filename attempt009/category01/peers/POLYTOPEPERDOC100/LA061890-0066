The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern

Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
Divers worked where the two creeks empty into the Ohio.
The body of a man was found Sunday afternoon in the Ohio River, a half-mile south of the mouth of Wegee Creek and about seven miles south of Shadyside, Vogt said.
"It's just been too long.
I don't think there's anybody alive out there," he said.
"You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River."
That left 18 still missing, Vogt said.
The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
