Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker

Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel "The Remains of the Day," judges announced Thursday.
Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English vacation, as "a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance."
After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel "The Satanic Verses" blasphemed their faith.
He writes in English.
Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel "An Artist of the Floating World."
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business.
