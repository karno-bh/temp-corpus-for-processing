Iraqi troops have launched an offensive

against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, "We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment."
Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Iraq then claimed Kuwait as part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred further action by Iraq.
