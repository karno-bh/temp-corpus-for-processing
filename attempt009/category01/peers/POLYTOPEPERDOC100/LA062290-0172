Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War,

"The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
"We always hoped that one day Checkpoint Charlie would no longer be needed, and now that day has arrived.
At long last, we are bringing Charlie in from the cold," he added.
Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.
Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Markus Meckel of East Germany also attended the ceremony.
