The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
But there was a third try, and it was successful.
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttle's mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttle's power and shifted over to the batteries.
The first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed 380 miles above South America's eastern coast.
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
