West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday

that "the way is now free" for German reunification.
"Political and economic union go hand in hand," Kohl said.
He said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to "stop the hemorrhage of East Germans to the Federal Republic and keep them in their heimat," or home, in East Germany.
And after the election, he said, "they will want to put their programs into practice quickly."
Gorbachev inquired about plans by West German politicians to campaign in East Germany, Kohl said, adding that the Soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity.
