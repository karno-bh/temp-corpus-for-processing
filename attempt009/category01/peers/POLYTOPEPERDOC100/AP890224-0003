To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor

Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used.
In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926.
English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperor's posthumous name.
The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor Meiji, Hirohito's grandfather.
The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was Showa 64 until Hirohito's death on Jan. 7.
