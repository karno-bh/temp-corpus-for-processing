Rescue workers coped with aftershocks

Sunday's pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government officials said.
The quake injured at least 2,000 people in India and 1,000 in Nepal, officials said.
"I have tried to tell them they are making a mistake, but no one will listen to me," said Dabal Singh, an inspector.
In general, however, the intensity of aftershocks has lessened.
"Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been declining," Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepal's Department of Geology, said in Katmandu.
