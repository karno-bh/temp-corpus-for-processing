Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen.

Thank you.
Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution.
Now, I don't mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience.
But Dan Quayle's got experience, too.
As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust.
I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr. Chairman.
