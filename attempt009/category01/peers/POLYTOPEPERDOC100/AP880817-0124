Port workers in Szczecin and

southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition activists said.
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity officials said.
The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, said the strike was illegal.
One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, was broken up by security forces.
The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of Solidarity, along with wage increases.
