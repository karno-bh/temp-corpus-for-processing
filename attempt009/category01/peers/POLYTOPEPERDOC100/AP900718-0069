The government today imposed direct

federal rule in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
The action follows the killing Tuesday of at least 29 Moslem militants by Indian security forces.
Relations between Pakistan and India worsened in January when Indian soldiers cracked down on Moslem militants in Kashmir who are seeking independence from India or union with Pakistan.
At least 792 people have been killed in Kashmir since then.
India has accused Pakistan of arming and training the militants, a charge Pakistan has denied.
India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir, in 1948 and 1965.
Both were won by India.
