'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance

The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.
This book attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining how it was achieved.
It did, and he did.
If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing retailer.
