Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region

are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
The miners's unions said the decision will be appealed.
The miners say the government has renedged on its promises.
The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes: Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth day, according to Tass.
