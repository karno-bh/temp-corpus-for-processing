The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver

The Broncos, on the other hand, lost the last four Super Bowl games they have played.
San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana made five touchdown passes, three to Jerry Rice, breaking a Super Bowl record for touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13 straight pass completions.
He also set five Super Bowl career records, including his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and San Francisco's point total was the most ever.
In four Super Bowls, he has thrown 11 touchdowns and no interceptions.
For Denver quarterback John Elway, it was a day of futility, ending with his third Super Bowl defeat.
