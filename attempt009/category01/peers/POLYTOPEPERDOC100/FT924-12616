THE LATE Mr Robert Maxwell liked to think of himself as a 'strong ' chess

'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge.
Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess Monthly and Bridge Monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire.
Despite the year of difficulties, Chess and Bridge is now set up in new premises in Euston Road, London.
