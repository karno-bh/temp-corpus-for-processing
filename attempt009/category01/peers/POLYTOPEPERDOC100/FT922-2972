ABOUT 20 banks became con-cerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses

At a meeting between Maxwell and Mr John Melbourn, a NatWest director, on July 10, NatWest refused Maxwell's request for a loan of Pounds 45m.
NatWest was forced to convert this 'intra-day' transaction into a short-term loan, which was eventually repaid.
The bank told both Robert Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made, but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the Bank of England.
NatWest's loans to the Maxwell empire now total Pounds 182m, half the level of two years ago.
