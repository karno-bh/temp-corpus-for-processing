Cabinet ministers rallied behind John Major

The answer's pretty obvious," said one Cabinet minister.
John Patten, the Secretary of State for Education, said: "He is a man of very great resilience.
Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said: "There is no prospect of any leadership contest.
"John Major has done himself great damage.
There's little doubt about that," he said.
However, Tory right wingers said last night that they would support Mr Major because there was no credible right-wing candidate.
Mr Portillo, 40, was too young and they still regarded Mr Heseltine as an interventionist left-winger.
It isn't going to stop me now."
