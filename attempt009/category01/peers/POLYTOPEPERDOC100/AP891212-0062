The Communist Party today admitted

that East Germany's socialist system has failed, and expressed support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
Neues Deutschland urged a "qualified partnership of both German states" but rejected any suggestions of resolving the "German question."
One sign said "Germany United Fatherland," using a phrase from the West German national anthem.
Others, opposing reunification, urged "No Fourth Reich" and no transformation of East Germany into West Germany's "plantation."
East Germany is a front line of defense for the Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 troops in the country.
