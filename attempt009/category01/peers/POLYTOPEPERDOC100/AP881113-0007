A representative of the African National Congress

said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
"There are very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released," said Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa.
He was transferred from prison to a hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis.
Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government.
Apartheid is South Africa's policy of racial separation.
