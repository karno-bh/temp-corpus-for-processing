John Lennon spent much of a three-year span

Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon "could not be more remote."
Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including time spent with his son, Sean, "Lennon is back here in his room, alone and silent."
Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
"I must have taken a thousand trips," the book quotes Lennon as saying.
Goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who was murdered eight years ago in New York.
