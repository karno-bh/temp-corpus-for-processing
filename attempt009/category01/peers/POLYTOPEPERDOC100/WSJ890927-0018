Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it won't cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.

The property claims service division of the American Insurance Service Group, a trade association, is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow.
In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers haven't had to dip into these funds.
For the time being, the losses from Hugo "will be substantial, but they won't be something the industry can't handle," said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James &amp; Co., a New York-based insurance broker.
For some insurers, Hugo was a double-whammy.
Right now, premiums total about $200 billion, he said.
State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, doesn't buy reinsurance.
