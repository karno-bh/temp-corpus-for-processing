Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music

Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas.
It was more than a superstar session.
Afterall, Lennon gave no press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts.
To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero.
The nerves quickly settled.
"Keep it simple, like Ringo."
Lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production lush.
Sushi was the food of choice.
The strongest drug was Brazilian coffee, freshly ground.
He was the spiritual leader.
