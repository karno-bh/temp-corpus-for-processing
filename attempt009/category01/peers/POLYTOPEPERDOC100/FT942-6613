Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being

old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
No wonder the Majors liked this film.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
(Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.)
And Major replied: 'It's simple.
This, of course, does not mean that Major made everything up.
His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
Except in the movies.
