The volcano, about 10 miles west of the air base, came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy. No casualties have been reported, but experts

are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon.; Gases, ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today, enshrouding it in thick, gray clouds of ash and steam that rose 12,000 feet.; The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters.; Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."
; He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from Clark.
The last major eruption occurred in 1965, when the Taal volcano, about 50 miles south of Manila, exploded.
About 200 people were killed.
