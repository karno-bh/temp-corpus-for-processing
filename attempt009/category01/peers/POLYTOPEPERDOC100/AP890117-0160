A man fired several dozen shots from an

automatic rifle in an elementary school Tuesday, killing six children, wounding at least 35 other people and then shooting himself in the head, authorities said.
"We have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot wound to the head," Deputy Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.
"We have at least 30 people that we've sent out to area hospitals," said Police Chief Jack Calkins.
The attack at Cleveland Elementary School came shortly before noon.
Police Sgt. James Monk said his office learned that a "man went berserk with an automatic weapon and we have several (people) down."
"Several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle," said Monk.
