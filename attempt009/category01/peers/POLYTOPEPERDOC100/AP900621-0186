The earthquake that devastated Iran early

Thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains, an earthquake expert said.
The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the people were in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
"It's very similar to what we had in Armenia," he said of the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.
"Iran is in a very active seismic region," he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.
