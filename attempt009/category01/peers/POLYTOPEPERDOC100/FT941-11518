Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the

curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell.
Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publisher's sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production.
However, he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers.
Press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the Maxwell brothers' lawyers .
Mr Alun Jones QC, Kevin Maxwell's barrister, led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent High Court ruling that Robert Maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in Berlitz, the publishing company.
