Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns.

The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young.
McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nations in the region.
South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say.
McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say.
"We are starting small," says Mr. Ahn.
Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere.
