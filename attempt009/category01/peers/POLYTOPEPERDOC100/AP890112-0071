U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime prime

minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a television documentary claims.
The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S. prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.
Behr is a Paris-based journalist.
His biography of China's last monarch was used for the award-winning film "The Last Emperor."
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying Japan, wrote in his book "Reminiscences" that he fended off pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
