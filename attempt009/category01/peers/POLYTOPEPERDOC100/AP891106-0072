Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has weakened her

She was elected in 1979, the first female prime minister in Europe, and won re-election in 1983 and in 1987, when she said she planned to "go on and on."
Mrs. Thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and her husband, Denis, will be 79 and "his age may have been a factor in her decision," the newspaper said.
Mentally, Margaret Thatcher is preparing herself for packing her bags."
"Even were she not to fight a fifth election, Mrs. Thatcher could yet enjoy seven more years in charge," it said.
