The motion picture industry's most coveted

award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
From 1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were later presented with the real thing.
The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and "reserves the right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop," said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.
The most-nominated film was "All About Eve" in 1950.
"Ben-Hur" in 1959 was the most-awarded film with 11, and Walt Disney was the most-awarded person with 32.
