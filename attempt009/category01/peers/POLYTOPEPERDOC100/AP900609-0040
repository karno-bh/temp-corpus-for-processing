Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against

protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper said today.
Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit eight cities from June 20 to July 1.
"There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage" at any public protest, Dinkins said.
Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's "unbending anti-Israel stance."
