Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who

is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital.
