After listening to reports submitted by the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do relief work, he issued important instructions.
This fully shows that, with party leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome all difficulties.
Regarding the work in the next stage, he pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural production.
