THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last

night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand.
The devices, mostly car bombs, appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were 'part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time'.
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
