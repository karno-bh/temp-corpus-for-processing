Indian frontier guards shot and killed 20

Moslem militants and arrested nine others after they sneaked into India-held Kashmir from Pakistan, a senior official said today.
India, alarmed by a spurt in Moslem separatist activities in Kashmir, has stepped up border patrol to stop alleged infiltration of separatists from Pakistan.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the porous border and return by the same route after reciving arms training in Pakistan.
The Kashmir official said the fighting erupted when the militants fired at Indian border guards after crossing over from Pakistan.
Kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the Moslem dominated Jammu-Kashmir from the predominantly Hindu India.
