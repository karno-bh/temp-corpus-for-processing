Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted

From now on Denis Thatcher will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife as Lady Thatcher, although she insisted Friday she wished to be known simply as "Mrs. Thatcher."
Thatcher said she was "deeply honored and moved" by the award.
Baronets date from 1611.
Sir Denis' title passes upon his death to his son, Mark, who is married to an American, and will eventually pass to Mark Thatcher's son, Michael.
Traditionally, retiring prime ministers of Britain were granted earldoms, although Churchill, for one, refused a peerage, preferring to remain in the House of Commons.
