East Germany's ousted secret police

chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper reported Wednesday.
82-year-old former security chief Erich Mielke shouted at Honecker, according to Bild newspaper.
Honecker, 78, was jailed for one day in January.
He was one of Honecker's closest aides.
Mielke remains in custody.
Honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations, one in West Germany for obstruction of justice.
Bild said the imprisoned Mielke also accused other former Communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against them.
