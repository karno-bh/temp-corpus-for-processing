One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has

become dull.
This was no small thing.
His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news.
Normally, a vice president would not be.
None of this happened.
The show was uneventful.
It was everything Quayle had hoped for.
"Well, he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job," Beckwith said.
And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992.
"Yes," Basham said, "but almost all the guests do."
After all, it worked for George Bush.
