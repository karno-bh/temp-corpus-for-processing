The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test,

The test, which isn't patented, is available in kit form to laboratories.
A high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure.
The test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises, tending to boost blood pressure, the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt.
On the other hand, in other patients with high blood pressure, the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood.
But, he wrote, "a larger, population-based study will be important in confirming the results of this paper."
