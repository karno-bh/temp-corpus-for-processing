The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday

One member, known as the "Jackal" after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel "The Day of the Jackal," has been eluding the authorities for two years.
One soldier was killed in that incident.
The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the rubble.
"The whole window was blown across the kitchen," Hackett recalled.
"The real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them, the 'godfathers' who send them to commit them, know that they will actually achieve nothing.
Terrorism is not going to win.
The statement was signed "P. O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau," a signature that has appeared on earlier IRA bombing claims.
