The Bush administration is expected to name

career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
Shlaudeman, who has served as ambassador to Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Venezuela, is a premier State Department specialist on Latin America and is expected to win easy Senate confirmation.
Shlaudeman, who will turn 64 next week, was approached by a senior State Department official weeks ago about going to Managua but said he was not interested.
When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
The U.S. official said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
