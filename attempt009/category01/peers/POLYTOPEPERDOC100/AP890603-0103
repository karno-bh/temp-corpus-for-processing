Chinese troops stormed Tiananmen Square early

Hundreds were wounded.
The square was in darkness.
Students sang the "Internationale," the communist anthem.
Ho Te-chien, a Taiwanese singer who defected to China in 1983 and has been active in the student movement, urged the students to leave.
A 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, set up by students last week, remained standing.
"This will disturb the United States government, and will disturb the American people, considerably," he said.
Students threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at them.
One armored personnel carrier rammed into a burning bus on Changan Avenue, the main street running along the square, and was torched by students.
