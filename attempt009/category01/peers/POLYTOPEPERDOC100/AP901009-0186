John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was

Happy birthday, John.
War or peace," said Lennon, whose son Sean turned 15 Tuesday.
The song, originally on the "White Album," was the first Lennon-McCartney single released since the Beatles broke up in 1969.
"The release date and John's birthday is just a happy coincidence, but it's also a nod and a wink to my old mate," said McCartney, 47.
MTV televised the "Imagine" video in 25 countries, said Andrea Smith, a spokeswoman for the network.
An anchorman, reporting on the worldwide birthday bash, described "Imagine" as an "anthem of peace."
