Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, "The Lives of John Lennon" (Morrow, $22.95), but you've got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger.

A can't-miss formula, surely.
Now Mr. Presley was, if you'll forgive the expression, a fat target for a writer of Mr. Goldman's methods.
But in choosing Mr. Lennon as his next target, Mr. Goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable.
By his own accounting, then, Mr. Lennon was not about to dethrone Ward Cleaver as the all-American dad.
And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject.
