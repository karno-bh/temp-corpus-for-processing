Forty years after Sam Walton first hung

The window displays date back to the store's opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnson's Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.

Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.
In one video, David Glass, who succeeded Sam Walton as chief executive of Wal-Mart in 1988, recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second Wal-Mart Discount City at Harrison in 1964.
The first store, at Rogers, opened two years earlier.
