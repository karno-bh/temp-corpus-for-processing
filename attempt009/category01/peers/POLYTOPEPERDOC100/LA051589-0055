Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is

on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving.
Economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and people are losing interest in them because they can't buy anything.
"The old centralized system is being dismantled, and that is right.
But the trouble is that it is not being replaced by anything new.
We can say that the country is on the brink of an economic catastrophe."
Sakharov was elected in April to the new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile.
