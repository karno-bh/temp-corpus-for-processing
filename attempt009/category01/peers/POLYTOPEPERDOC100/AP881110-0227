Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet

dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder, the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky.
Sakharov, wearing a blue beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception and entered a waiting limousine.
