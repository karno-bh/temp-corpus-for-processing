COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform

The miners' position seems untenable.
According to the ministry, if the miners' pay demands were met, the cost of their coal would double.
The strike seems motivated by a number of factors.
Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
Mr Cosma, however, appears confident.
In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'With miners, anything is possible.'
