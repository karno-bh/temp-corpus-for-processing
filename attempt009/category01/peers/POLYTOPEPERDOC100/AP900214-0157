The chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center has

asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss "the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of Nazism."
"However, if that is the inevitable course, let us at least place on record our concerns," he said.
"You are undoubtedly aware," he wrote both leaders, "of the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of Nazism."
Hier listed 10 points he wanted to raise.
Among them were a program to teach German schoolchildren about the annhilation of the Jews; the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate groups; the continuation of the "special relationship" now existing between West Germany and Israel; the convening of a 1992 conference of world leaders on the 50th anniversary of the conference at which "the final solution" was developed; the establisment of a German commission to protect Holocaust sites; the banning of terrorist organizations that "have enjoyed respectablity in East Germany;" a cultural exchange program between German and Jewish organizations; German television and radio programs on the reconciliation; restitution payments to the families and victims of Nazism, and a German commitment to revitalize former synagogues in East German territory.
