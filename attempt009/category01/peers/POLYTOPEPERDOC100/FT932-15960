ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by

winning the general election.
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political point-scoring over the government's record.
While Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,' he also claimed that much had been achieved.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment of Mr Major's failures.
He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of pre-election commitments'.
But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction.
