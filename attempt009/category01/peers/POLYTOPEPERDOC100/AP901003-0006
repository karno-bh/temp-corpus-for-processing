An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol

of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone.
At the start of the study, their average cholesterol levels were 251.
The surgery lowered people's cholesterol 23 percent.
