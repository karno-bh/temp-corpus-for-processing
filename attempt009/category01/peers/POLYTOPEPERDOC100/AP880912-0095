Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph

"Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica," said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
"It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane," Sheets said.
Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and Haiti.
"All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane," the service said, adding, "Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica."
