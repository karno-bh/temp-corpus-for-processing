The death of Emperor Hirohito finished the list of political and military

leaders of the World War II era, one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the European or Asian continents.
He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because "it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors."
Of course, some Japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for.
