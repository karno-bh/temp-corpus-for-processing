Tank-led Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait before dawn

The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smaller Kuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
The invaders surrounded the palace of the ruler of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the official said.
The whereabouts of the emir, whose family has ruled the city-state for almost 250 years, was not immediately known.
The bombardment of ports and airports was vicious, eyewitnesses said.
The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned away.
Reaction was swift elsewhere.
There was no further identification of the revolutionary government.
