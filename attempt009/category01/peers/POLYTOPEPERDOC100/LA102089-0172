On Telegraph Hill, Jerry Lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his

apartment after the deadly earthquake.
"There was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood," he said.
The connections just break, and the front end falls into the street."
The worst areas, they believed, would be Chinatown and the Tenderloin, where brick buildings abound.
But most buildings, including the landmark Transamerica Pyramid, were not touched.
Jay Cahill, an owner of Cahill Construction Co., a contractor that built several high-rises in the city, said the earthquake codes "did their job."
In Los Gatos, 30 miles northeast of Santa Cruz, portions of the downtown area were destroyed.
"If a (big) aftershock comes, it'll collapse," he said.
