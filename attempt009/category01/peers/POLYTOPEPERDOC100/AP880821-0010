A strong earthquake triggered landslides

In Nepal, authorities said at least 137 people were dead.
"My bed rattled, then it began swinging," said R.N. Rudra, a resident of Patna, the Bihar capital.
The quake also was felt in Sikkim and Tripura, located in the Himalayan foothills, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
In India's Bihar state, communications with Darbhanga, which appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted.
The quake damaged most of the houses in Darbhanga, the news agency said, quoting P.K. Patnaik, the top civil administrator in the district.
