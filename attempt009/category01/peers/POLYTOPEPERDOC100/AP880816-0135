More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in

the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.
Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift.
She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarity and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
The workers are also calling for higher wages and better working conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to assist them in the negotiations.
Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of Silesia to experience unrest.
