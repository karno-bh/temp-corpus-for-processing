Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher

legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying "nationalist passions" benefit opponents of his reforms.
"Perestroika," or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for widespread economic and social change.
The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18.
Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, the party's policy-making body.
Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a "current aggravation" of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said.
Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion.
