Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said

Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for "West Side Story," hosted the 75-minute tribute to Bernstein, 72, who died Oct. 14.
"Wherever Lenny was, was theater; his every move was a stage direction," he said, as many in the audience laughed knowingly.
Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of "West Side Story," sang a medley of "I Feel Pretty" and "Tonight."
Nancy Walker sang her sassy "I Can Cook Too" from "On the Town."
Kurt Ollmann, familiar from Bernstein's 1985 "West Side Story" recording, sang "Take Care of This House" from Bernstein's last (1976), unsuccessful, Broadway show, "1600 Pennsylvania Ave." -- a work the composer often spoke of wanting to revise.
