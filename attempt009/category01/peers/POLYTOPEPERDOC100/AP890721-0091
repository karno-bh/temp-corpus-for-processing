Coal miners in Siberia ended their

strike today after exacting promises of better food, housing and working conditions, but the wave of unrest they launched continued in other key coal regions.
In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of the Ukraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputy minister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.
Strikes were also reported in the Pechora Coal Basin in the Russian republic, and Chervonograd in the western Ukraine, official media said.
The strike wave began 11 days ago in Kuznetsk, the country's second-largest coal field.
Until Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, strikes were not tolerated.
