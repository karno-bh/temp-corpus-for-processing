The government on Thursday allowed for the

possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.
West Germany has proposed a plan for greater unity, but East German leaders reject reunification.
Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between Poland and East Germany.
East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified Germany would also acknowledge the border.
He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
