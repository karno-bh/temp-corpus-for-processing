Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston

"Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica," said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
"It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane," he said.
"They have reported maximum winds of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots," said Ross.
"But there are no reports of injuries or damage."
Residents of the neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were urged to "rush all preparatory actions."
