More than 100 people were feared drowned

after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern Bangladesh, police said today.
Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near Chandpur late Tuesday, police said.
Six passengers, including a pregnant woman, were thrown overboard and have not been found, Chandpur police said.
The pirate attack on the second ferry, the M.V. Sagar, also occurred on the Meghna River.
The Sagar was en route from Dhaka to Barisal when about 50 pirates launched their attack near Chandpur, 34 miles southeast of Dhaka.
The attackers escaped in waiting boats, the police added.
