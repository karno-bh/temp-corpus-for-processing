GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance

claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could 'cost it as much as Dollars 40m.'
However, if this happens, it would suffer a post-tax loss of Dollars 40m (Pounds 20m).
The company's loss adjusters are in the area trying to estimate the losses.
Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have been estimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.
However, other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as Dollars 1bn in total.
Mr Robertson said: 'No one knows at this time what the exact loss is'.
