While Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph wind

As Hugo's wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of Riley's office.
As the eye of the storm passed, he took reporters onto the porch of the 188-year-old brick City Hall to look at the damage.
"This is the eye of the hurricane.
I've never been in one and I hope I'm never in one again," Riley said.
As the storm died before dawn, Riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage.
"Serious but fixable," the mayor concluded.
