President Corazon Aquino said today

Mrs. Aquino's daughter, Maria Elena Cruz, said the president had received no calls from Mrs. Marcos.
"This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for the country," Imelda said.
"I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos," Mrs. Aquino said.
Traders said rumors of Marcos' death triggered a selling wave shortly before noon.
In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Mrs. Marcos planned to make one last appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to return home.
