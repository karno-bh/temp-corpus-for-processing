Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said

"The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time," she said following a tour of the school's wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England.
"We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic views," she said.
"They are very evil people, absolute monsters."
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks, saying "she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the conflict, its cause and the remedy."
