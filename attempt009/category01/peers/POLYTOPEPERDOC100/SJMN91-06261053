The committee will continue to hear testimony for and against Thomas atleast through the end of the week, but the outcome does not seem to be in

doubt.
Regardless of the outcome, Thomas said on his way out of the hearing, "I have been treated fairly."
; Before Thomas' testimony ended, the unflappable 43-year-old federal judge was criticized, sometimes in harsh terms, by several liberal Democrats.
; "I want to look into the window of your soul," Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said to Thomas.
"but I find the shade down quite a bit."
; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., delivered a long, stinging lecture to Thomas, declaring: "The vanishing views of Judge Thomas have become a major issue in these hearings."
