About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West

German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a "sorrowful state" and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
"Things are escalating," Waigel said in an interview with West Berlin radio.
"The economy is in a sorrowful state.
The political authority is crumbling."
Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet helicopters in their country, ADN said.
ADN said the demonstrators held signs saying "Gorbi, what about disarmament?"
