Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry

Officials had yet to determine the exact cause of the sinking, but Giron Arreola said the ferry captain was slow to respond to requests by the skipper of the naval patrol boat to take control of the ferry's wheel once it was under tow.
He said the patrol boat captain believed the ferry's rudder was unmanned while under tow.
Esquibel radioed that he had taken the wheel just as the boat began to capsize, Giron Arreola said.
Giron Arreola also said that passengers ran to one side of the ferry while it was under tow just before the ferry sank.
No Americans were on board, he said.
