Pakistani and Indian troops

A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops.
The western observer said Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appeared to back up that assertion.
"It is not a normal situation," the officer said.
"The border is extremely tense."
Pakistan officials said they were taking steps to quell what one official called "war fever" on the Pakistan side.
He said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him "to ask for orders" to fight the Indian army.
