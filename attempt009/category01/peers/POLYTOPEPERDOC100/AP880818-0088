A drug used to treat patients complaining

Surprisingly, however, the study found that the drug, diltiazem, increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally, experts said.
The results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients, Moss said.
The study involved 2,466 heart attack patients, who were given either 240 milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo.
Overall, the drug only decreased additional heart attacks 11 percent, which was not statistically significant, Moss said.
But in patients who had normal or near-normal heart pump function _ 1,909 patients or 80 percent of the total group _ diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by 25 percent, Moss said.
