An anti-American newspaper in Iran said

"Our people, even under the rubble, chant 'Death to America' and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even those hands stretched out to help," it said.
"If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing, stop hatching plots," the newspaper said.
It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the United States and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the Iranian people."
