The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met

to implement the "final solution" against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification.
"The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification," said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.
For example, Germany's borders "must be sealed in cement," and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons, he said.
"Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be blaming the Jews" for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.
