Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border

crossing by the Berlin Wall, was to be hauled away Friday.
The envoys from the German states and the four World War II Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the international aspects of German unification.
Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.
With huge sections of the Berlin Wall being ripped down daily, U.S. officials decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.
Thursday night, they merely waved Westerners through their side of the checkpoint, although some tourists demanded their documents be checked.
