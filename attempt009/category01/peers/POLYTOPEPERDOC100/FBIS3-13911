The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is

a heavyweight.
Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who were they occupied by?
These territories, contended the senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state of Israel.
Mr. Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are up for grabs.
The United States, he noted, never recognized Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank.
His bottom line: Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's sovereignty.
