Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake

And devastating quakes are not new to the country.
The Iranian media, monitored from Nicosia, was quick to report Thursday's earthquake.
Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
The report said that many people fled into the streets.
In addition, the news agency's earliest reports dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the disaster.
Iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast 6 1/2 hours later.
But again, the reporting lacked color and description for hours.
The television's first shots from the stricken north were screened 12 hours after the quake with no comment from reporters.
