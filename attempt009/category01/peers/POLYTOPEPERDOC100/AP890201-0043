An Argentine supply ship that ran

The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins, sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation statement said.
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
But 104 crewmen remain at the station, said Renerie.
Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement said.
