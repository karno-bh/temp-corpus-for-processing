Lucille Ball, whose death Wednesday morning at the age of 77 will be the most

The movies prepared her for television.
To look at the "I Love Lucy" reruns today, as everybody does, again and again, is to realize how superbly professional they are.
They were wholly, prototypically American, and that is central to their popularity abroad.
Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world.
The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies.
As always, her timing was impeccable.
Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course.
