Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts

Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations.
Buckey and his mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one shared count of conspiracy.
One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge "if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons."
A split verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge.
It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking their heads in confusion.
