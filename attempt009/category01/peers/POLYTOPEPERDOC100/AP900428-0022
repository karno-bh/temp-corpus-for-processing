The shuttle that put the Hubble Space

The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan.
"We believe the Hubble Space Telescope will do the same thing."
Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.
"This provided observational evidence for the concept, suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is expanding," the institute said.
The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving move.
