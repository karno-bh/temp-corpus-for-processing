John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her

successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister.
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected.
Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.
Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever whom Thatcher encouraged.
Major became a banker and a Conservative Party activist and was elected to Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979.
