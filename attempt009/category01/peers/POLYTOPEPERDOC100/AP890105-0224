Retired Sen. John Tower, the defense

secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
"Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition," hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.
A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Tower's surgeon, Dr. R.D. Dignan, of Dallas.
When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.
Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Tower's surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.
