Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin

Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced.
Asked if her son was surprised, she said.
"He had fear, definitely."
It will just be another six-year travesty," Lagunoff said.
Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the matter differently.
Jurors agreed.
Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of Raymond Buckey.
