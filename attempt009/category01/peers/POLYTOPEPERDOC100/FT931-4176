A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock

market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers' books.
It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration.
The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made out of context and blown out of proportion.'
In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body, avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m).
Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions.
Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its building.
