Former President Reagan thanked British Prime

"Margaret Thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity," Reagan said in a statement after Mrs. Thatcher announced her impending retirement.
"I could always count on her wise counsel, her firm support, and her loyal friendship," Reagan said.
Reagan sided with Mrs. Thatcher.
"She stood up to the Soviets and let them know she meant business," he said.
Like Reagan, however, Mrs. Thatcher was accused by liberals of widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country, and both clashed with organized labor.
