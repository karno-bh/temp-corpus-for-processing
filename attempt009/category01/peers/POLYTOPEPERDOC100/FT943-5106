The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction,

from many in the publishing industry.
According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the award according to some critics.
'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.'
The winner, selected from an original 130, will be announced on October 11.
