Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San

The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasn't clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.
The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again.
That suggested a bigger quake might happen in the San Francisco Bay area sooner than some believed.
Others disagreed.
"Clearly, scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one," Heaton said.
As bad as Tuesday's quake was, "it was not a 1906 earthquake," Geological Survey director Dalas Peck said.
The question is when," Peck said.
