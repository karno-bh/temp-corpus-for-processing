Five astronauts boarded Discovery

The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give astronomers "a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have," said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
It is the skull's third trip into space.
