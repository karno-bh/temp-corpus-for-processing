Taking a break from the headaches of the

Palestinian uprising and Israel's election campaign, thousands of Israelis turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant.
About 20,000 people attended the two-day show, organizers said.
Marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club based in Brussels, Belgium, and had judges from the Netherlands, South Africa, Italy and Britain.
This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began, when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to Israel.
The show briefly pushed the Nov. 1 general elections out of the limelight for the doglovers.
