Tens of thousands of people chanting

trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witnesses and pro-separatist activists said.
At least three people died in two separate incidents on Saturday in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign, witnesses said.
Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a plebiscite in Kashmir, police said.
India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants.
