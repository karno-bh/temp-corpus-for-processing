Spike Lee may have been wearing a

Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmer reception from Syracuse University students than he did from Academy Award voters.
The academy's membership consists mainly of "old people," the 32-year-old Lee said.
"I still feel we made the best film of the year," he said.
Asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations, Lee replied, "Racism's involved in everything."
Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed him as one of their own.
"That's why we're so proud of him."
