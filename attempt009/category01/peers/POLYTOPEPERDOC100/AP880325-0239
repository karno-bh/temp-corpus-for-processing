What do Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, Cary

"This is the last thing I expected to happen.
There was no mention of the fact that Spielberg is primarily a director, not a producer.
Douglas Fairbanks, Judy Garland, Noel Coward, Ernst Lubitsch, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Harold Lloyd, Greta Garbo, Maurice Chevalier, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant, Lillian Gish, Edward G. Robinson, Groucho Marx, Howard Hawks and Jean Renoir are others who have received honorary awards.
Billy Wilder's classic comedy, "Some Like It Hot," failed to be nominated as best picture, as did Chaplin's "Modern Times," Hawks' "Red River" and Woody Allen's "Manhattan."
Oh, well.
