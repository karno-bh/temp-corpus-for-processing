On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his

sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his "Mass" and "Chichester Psalms."
Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from Bernstein's writings, included Bernstein's three children, son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
The concert began with selections from Bernstein's "Mass," which he composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and ended with Psalm 133, in Hebrew, from Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms."
