INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed

two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores of others.
At least 45 people were dead on arrival at hospital, they said.
Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
Mr Rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the 'inhuman and criminal blast'.
