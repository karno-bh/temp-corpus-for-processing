Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators

embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute, sources said.
Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border.
The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week, when Iraq began threatening Kuwait.
There were no details on the negotiations, but sources said the meetings will continue Wednesday.
Kuwaiti officials also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused.
In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation left for Jiddah with fanfare and publicity.
