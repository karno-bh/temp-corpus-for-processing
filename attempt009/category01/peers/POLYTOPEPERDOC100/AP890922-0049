This historic city has survived the

ravages of earthquake, battle and storm in its storied 300-year-history, but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in Hurricane Hugo.
The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston Thursday night.
"This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced," warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.
In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches.
