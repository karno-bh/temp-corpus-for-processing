Grief-stricken family and friends mourned

At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the school's 970 pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine school day.
"They're making it back, slowly but surely," she said, adding that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son's side in the classroom.
Cleveland School is in the heart of California's third-largest community of refugees from Southeast Asia, and nearly two-thirds of the school's population is from Asia.
All of the dead children were from refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded.
This is a crazy action from one individual.
