A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill

"It created a wall of water," said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
Williams said 40 to 60 people were unaccounted for at midday.
"It's a disaster here."
Shadyside -- about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va.
-- is in Belmont County, a mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio.
"There are a lot of trailers out in this area that got hit," he said.
Two people were accounted for, she said.
There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking County in central Ohio.
