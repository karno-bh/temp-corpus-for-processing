Moslems blew up a truck carrying security

In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in an exchange of fire between militants and security forces, officials said.
Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state.
There were no casualties, he said.
Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, is the center of the separatist movement.
It did not name the members, but it said they would go Thursday.
Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India.
