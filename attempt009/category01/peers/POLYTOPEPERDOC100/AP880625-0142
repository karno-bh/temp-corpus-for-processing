President Corazon Aquino has agreed

Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos into the Philippines, citing security reasons.
Mrs. Aquino's government has said it will file criminal charges against Marcos, whom it has accused of stealing up to $10 billion in government funds.
But the government has not done so because of Mrs. Aquino's refusal to let Marcos enter the country.
The Swiss government has frozen the assets of Marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the Philippine government because of legal challenges posed by Marcos' lawyers and Swiss banks.
Benigno was quoted as saying that Mrs. Aquino "has to accept the possibility of Marcos returning home."
