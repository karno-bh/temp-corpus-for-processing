In the 15 months since he walked free from prison, Nelson Mandela hasplayed the chief role in talks with President F.W. de Klerk and the white

government.
He has presided over an African National Congress divided and not yet organized for politics.
He has loyally defended her innocence.
He has seemed to hear no voice to the contrary.
But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the South African drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end.; One reason for a degree of optimism is the way South Africans on all sides, most of them, have dealt with Winnie Mandela's trial: calmly and fairly.; During the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused.
; A more fundamental reason for hope is that F.W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela -- and those for whom they speak -- have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial South Africa.
; The time factor is crucial now.
World and time press on Nelson Mandela.
