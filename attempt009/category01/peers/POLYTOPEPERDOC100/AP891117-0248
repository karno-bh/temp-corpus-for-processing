The beer gridiron is going to be a busy and

expensive place on television this January.
Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., are gearing up to sell their beer with by staging mock football games in television commercials in conjunction with Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans.
The first such game was staged during the last Super Bowl.
"We're talking about real-life talent."
Miller's campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl television spots allocated for beer advertising.
Miller has a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to the Super Bowl.
