TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian

enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians.
Azerbaijani and Armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack.
No dates have been given for the withdrawal.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations.
Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory.
