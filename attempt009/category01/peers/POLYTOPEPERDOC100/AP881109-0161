The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.

Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. "Star Wars" program.
That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United States, which began Sunday.
Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's blueprint for political and electoral reforms.
