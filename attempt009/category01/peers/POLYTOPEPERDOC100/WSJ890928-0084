Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.

St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire &amp; Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
