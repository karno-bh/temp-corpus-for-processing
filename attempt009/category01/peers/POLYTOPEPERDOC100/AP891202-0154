Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured

visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
There is growing discussion in West Germany about German reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in East Germany.
But the Soviets, who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have said the idea of German reunification is "dangerous and unrealistic."
Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, "There is much to work with there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the (NATO) alliance."
