Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was

Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said.
Vogel is East Germany's most prominent lawyer.
West German television showed an impassive Honecker being led out of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness.
Honecker's daughter, son-in-law and youngest grandchild also came to see him off at the hospital, ADN quoted Vogler as saying.
On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
