He pinpointed the wreck on May 3, he said.
"When I dived, I found ships' timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects _ Islamic cooking pots, cannon balls, a candlestick, even a chalice from a Greek Orthodox church," he said.
I think there may be gold and silver items as well," he said.
"I also saw what I recognized as human bones," he added.
Kanaris and his crew of Greeks escaped.
Papathanassopoulos said the 162-foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet, but he said, "This is a ship that must be explored."
