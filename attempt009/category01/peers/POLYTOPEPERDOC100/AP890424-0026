Navy investigators will be looking at all

"They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error, or anything technical," said Lt. Janet Mescus, a spokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., the ship's home port.
The Iowa returned to Norfolk on Sunday.
"They're moving as quickly as they can," Lt. Mescus said, but added, "They want to be thorough and that takes time."
There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.
