The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today

endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panel's chairman said he feared Secchia might "embarrass the United States" because of his "penchant for making gross remarks."
The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., voted "present," meaning they took no position.
But Pell said he was unpersuaded.
"I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States," Pell said.
