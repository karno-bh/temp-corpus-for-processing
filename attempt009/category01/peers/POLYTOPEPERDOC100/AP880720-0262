The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day affair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise money for the music center.
But the highlight of the new season is the celebration of Bernstein's birthday.
The following night, Ozawa and special guests will appear in a Music Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernstein's influence on other musicians.
All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund, and to a fund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors.
Events climax in 1990 with observances marking the 50th year of the music center, the festival's school.
