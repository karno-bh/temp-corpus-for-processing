The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers,

"thugs," bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing.
Other sources, compiling various reports and surveys, estimated more than 1,000 people had been killed.
That number has increased with additional details and rumors of killings.
Some officials of China's Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijing's Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures.
Beijing University students said 150 of their fellow students who were in the square are missing.
Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students.
The exact number of people killed may never be known.
And the death toll mounts.
