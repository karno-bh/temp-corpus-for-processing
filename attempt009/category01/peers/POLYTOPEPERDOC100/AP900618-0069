The death toll from last week's flash

Heavy rain fell for about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.
Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.
That creek never flooded.
Then this.
Everybody just got wiped out," said Julia Kulazenka.
Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetched handsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka.
Now, you couldn't give it away," Kulazenka said.
