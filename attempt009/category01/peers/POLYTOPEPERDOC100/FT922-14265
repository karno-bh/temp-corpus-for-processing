SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation. The

son of an Oklahoma real-estate broker, he opened the first general store in what was to become the Wal-Mart chain in Bentonville, in the backwaters of Arkansas, in 1950, writes Martin Dickson.
The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.
Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.
'Low prices always' became Wal-Mart's motto.
