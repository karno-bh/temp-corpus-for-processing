The bodies of four Moslems were found in

The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen Moslem organizations fighting for independence of the Kashmir valley from India.
Police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar.
At least three soldiers were injured, they said.
The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem.
Jammu-Kashmir is the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Moslem militants earlier had demanded union with Pakistan, the Islamic nation on India's western border.
But, of late, they have been demanding independence and the status of a neutral nation.
