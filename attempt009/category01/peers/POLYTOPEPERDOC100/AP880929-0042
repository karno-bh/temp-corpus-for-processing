Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed

a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the 200-meter sprint.
Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds, shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat.
In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran an Olympic record 21.76 seconds.
Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the final 100 meters.
"I know I can run much faster," she said.
"I felt very relaxed.
That's the key."
