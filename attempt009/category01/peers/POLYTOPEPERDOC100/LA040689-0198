Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly anti-Communist prime minister "love arguing."
Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain with Gorbachev at her side, Thatcher told reporters: "The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues."
Gorbachev did not respond, he said.
He said Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been "not as frank as they should be" about their chemical weapons arsenal.
He quoted Gorbachev as replying: "If you aren't fully satisfied, then quite clearly we have to have more exchanges.
