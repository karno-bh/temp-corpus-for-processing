The parents of a Peace Corps worker

Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said Peter Giaquinta was "fine as far as we know."
In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was safe.
The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the family had had of her safety.
"We're ecstatic," he said, adding that his sister had been living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake epicenter.
There are no Peace Corps members in India, he said.
"We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains," Flanigan said.
