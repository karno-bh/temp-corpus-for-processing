Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake.

Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains.
Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area.
State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California.
Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.
That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia.
Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated.
