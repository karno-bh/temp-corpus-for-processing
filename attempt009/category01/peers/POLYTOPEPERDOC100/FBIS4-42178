Berlin -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of

state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning [29 May], according to his lawyer.
However, everything that was sensible had been done with regard to his cancer.
Becker could not comment on the exact cause of Honecker's death.
This will be decided by the family.
He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay in Chile.
Since then, he and his wife had been living in a house in a wealthy Santiago area.
