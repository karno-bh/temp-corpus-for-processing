Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
"We had no radar or satellites then, so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate," Clark said.
"Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job," Emmanuel said.
"We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products," Pyke said, "and that it's ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storm's path."
