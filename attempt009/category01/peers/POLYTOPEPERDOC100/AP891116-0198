A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest

The storm also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew the windows out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia and destroyed a house in Piscataway, N.J.
In Wyckoff, N.J., high winds knocked a power line onto a gas line, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of 20 homes, according to police.
No houses were burned.
Tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana.
The lights, powered by generators, produced an eerie glow in a area that was otherwise largely without power.
