SQUADS of workers fanned out across storm-battered Louisiana yesterday to

begin a massive rebuilding effort after Hurricane Andrew had flattened whole districts, killing two people and injuring dozens more, agencies report from Florida and New Orleans.
However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.
The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.
Louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of storm-related injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 100.
Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday.
