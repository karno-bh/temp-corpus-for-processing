Yeltsin, the triumphant leader of the resistance against this week'smilitary coup, has drastically tipped the balance of power here, showing

himself to be at least the political equal, if not the master, of Gorbachev.
; Gorbachev, who has insisted the party is still capable of reform, stammered a bit and then said, "Boris Nikolayevich, Boris Nikolayevich . . ." With an expression that was half-smile, half-sneer, Yeltsin broke in.
"It's been signed," he said definitively, and the deputies broke out in cheering and applause.
; In both Moscow and Leningrad, city officials ordered police to seal off Communist Party headquarters.
