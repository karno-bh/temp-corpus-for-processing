Pakistani troops fired on Indian

Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guards killed as many as six.
Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about half an hour, the spokesman said.
No one was hurt.
A Pakistani official in Islamabad denied the accusations.
An official of the Indian border security force, which normally patrols the border, said the Indian army today took control of the cease-fire line.
"It was becoming very difficult, our troops had to open fire," he said.
Thirty-one people were wounded in the shooting, Haider said.
Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of only one death.
