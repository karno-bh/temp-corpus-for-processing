Communism suffered its first Big Mac

"No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such a sensation as this one today," one policeman said.
"I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade," said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger.
"It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive."
"Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market," said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the Genex-McDonald's.
Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, "We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe."
