World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R.

"Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put their heads together and build on these developments," Kaunda said.
In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures of Mandela, celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square.
In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was delighted at the news, which he called "a tremendous victory for the people of South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign."
"It is not yet time to demobilize the international support for apartheid's victims," he said.
