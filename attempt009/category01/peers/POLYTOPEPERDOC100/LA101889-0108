There are events one never forgets.

Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated.
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
I opened the door to the trailer and looked out.
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
I walked into the stadium to interview fans.
