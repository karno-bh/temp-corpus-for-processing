Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet

Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begun their own separatist movements.
The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians, declared a new republic in southern Moldavia.
All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians.
It is spoken by two-thirds of the republic's residents.
Volunteer brigades of college-age Moldavians, who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement, were ordered dissolved by Gorbachev's decree.
The volunteers were organized by nationalist groups, including the Moldavian People's Front.
