More than 2,500 dogs, representing 138 breeds, will compete for prizes at

Sunday's All Breed Dog Show and Obedience Trials at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
For families who are thinking about getting a dog, this is a chance to size up the possibilities and talk with pet owners about the advantages and disadvantages of different breeds.
In the scent relay, teams of dogs will jump over hurdles and locate the jackets of their owners.
A computer is provided for visitors' use to find out which breeds would best suit their life styles.
Show hours are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: adults, $4.50; children, $1.
