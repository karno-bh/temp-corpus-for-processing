Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.
The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne.
"The kids are nonchalant, normal kids," said Mrs. Saddler.
"The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus," said Mrs. Quayle, 39.
Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said.
