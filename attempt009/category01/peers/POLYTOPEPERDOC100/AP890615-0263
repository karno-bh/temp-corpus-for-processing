Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton

"People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him," said store manager Paul Sively.
"He shook their hands and talked to everyone he could.
The registers were out for about 45 minutes, and I don't think we had one customer complain."
Walton continued talking with customers during the concert.
He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.
"He was up there saying, 'Give me a W, give me an A,' and the customers went right along with him," Sively said.
"He even got down to do a cheerleader's squiggle."
