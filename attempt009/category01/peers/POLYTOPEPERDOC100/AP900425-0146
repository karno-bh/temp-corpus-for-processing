Discovery's astronauts overcame

"Discovery, go for Hubble release," Mission Control told the crew at 3:37 p.m. EDT.
"We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed," the telescope control center in Maryland said.
"So we have good news," said Dave Drachlis, of the Hubble control center.
The race is on.
The clock is ticking."
That was to put the telescope's solar arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescope's fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.
The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earth's distorting atmosphere.
"Everybody is in excellent spirits."
