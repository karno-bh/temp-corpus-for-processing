Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Floods have all

Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August.
Meanwhile, 740 million yuan in loans and another 50 million yuan in donations have also been sent to flooded areas in Guangdong Province.
While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the key to mitigating economic losses is to resume production as soon as possible.
As one of China's major bread baskets, Jiangxi is of key importance to China in agricultural production, Wen said.
