Iraq's powerful army invaded this small oil-rich

kingdom early today.
Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials said.
_The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, halted weapons sales.
In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000 troops at the border.
Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, was killed while trying to defend the palace.
Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
"We were totally unprepared," said Catherine Baker of Illinois.
