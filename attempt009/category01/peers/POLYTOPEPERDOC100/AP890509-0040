Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears

"She was a whole package.
I love her," said a tearful Carol Burnett following a memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.
"She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love ourselves," Wall said.
Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, "The Lucy Show" and "Here's Lucy," aired Monday nights.
"I Love Lucy" had starting times on Mondays and other days.
"Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced happiness," said Schuller at the Santa Monica service.
