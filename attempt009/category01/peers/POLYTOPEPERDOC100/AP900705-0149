A natural substance called transforming growth

"TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack," said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at Jefferson.
For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, "the damage from the attack was much less severe.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
Thus, by measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could determine the amount of heart damage.
TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.
