A freighter carrying a cargo of

beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28 nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.
There were no casualties, he said.
They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said.
