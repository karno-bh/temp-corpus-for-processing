Iran is deliberately underreporting the number

"The regime is very much fearful of public outrage," said Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
"They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks."
"They have been very late in assisting the people," he said.
Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken residents.
This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home," he said.
"There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the United States," he said.
