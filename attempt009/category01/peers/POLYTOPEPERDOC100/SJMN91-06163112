A huge cloud of ash-laden steam rose up to 11,500 feet above the volcano today, spreading ash over a six-mile radius, the Philippine Institute of

Vulcanology and Seismology said.; If it does erupt, the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining Clark Air Base, he said.
; Pinatubo's last eruption, 600 years ago, is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock -- half a cubic kilometer -- as Mount St. Helens did when it erupted in 1980.
Until volcanologists' attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring, it had not been studied well.; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubo's primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.; "In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered" with glowing ash, Lipman said.; Just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal.
