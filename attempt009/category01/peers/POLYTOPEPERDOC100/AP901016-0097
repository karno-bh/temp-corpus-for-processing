Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents

Famed for his gymnastics at the podium, Bernstein composed symphonies as well as movie scores and Broadway shows such as "West Side Story," "On the Town" and "Candide."
"He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no doubt about it," said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of "West Side Story," said Bernstein himself played the piano for him during rehearsals.
"I was the new kid on the block and he stroked me and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that."
