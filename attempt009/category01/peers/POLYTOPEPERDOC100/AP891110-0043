The Oscar statuette, one of the most

recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.
Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling "comes as a shock to me."
The academy said it would appeal.
The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
