The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.

The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africa's gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the union's general secretary.
If workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes, a total of 300,000 miners could be on strike, he said.
"The total mines that will be affected are 28 gold mines around the country and 18 collieries," the union official said.
He said such other companies included De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's largest diamond miner.
