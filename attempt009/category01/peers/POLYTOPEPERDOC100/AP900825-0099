Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will

not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18, paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in March.
Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany's former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East Germany.
I am a dead man," Bild quoted Mielke, 82, as saying at his last interrogation.
