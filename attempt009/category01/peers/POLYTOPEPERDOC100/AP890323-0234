The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this

Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
"Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his bank account," says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.
He was born in Kingfisher, Okla., and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
Sam is still chairman of the board.
The Walton family will always be involved, he adds.
