Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free

It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment.
Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary.
Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates.
This, despite the unreliability of German money supply data.
We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.
The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of Bundesbank interest rate policies.
