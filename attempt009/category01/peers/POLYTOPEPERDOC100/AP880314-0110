The communist world gets its first

McDonald's next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica.
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of the American restaurant depends on its acceptance by Yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburger-like Pljeskavica.
It is sold at fast-food restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar.
The next East European McDonald's is scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic, another Genex official.
Negotiations have been going on for years for expanding the fast-food chain to the Soviet Union, but no agreement has been announced.
