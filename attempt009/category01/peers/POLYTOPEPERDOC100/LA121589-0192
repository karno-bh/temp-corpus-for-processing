World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today

Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity."
"It's a great loss," Gorbachev said.
"He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly.
Bush said that "all of us are diminished" and that Sakharov "embodied all of what is good and decent in the human spirit."
Just as he truly enriched all of us with his life, all of us are diminished by his untimely death."
"He was just a remarkable person," said British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
