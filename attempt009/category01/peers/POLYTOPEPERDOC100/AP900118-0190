Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation

"The CII interviews _ I could not accept them," Mrs. Williams said.
All the questions were leading.
They never had a chance to tell their stories," said juror John Breese, 51, a medical technician and grandfather of five.
"The police letter should never have been sent," said juror Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker.
At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested.
"We just dismissed those," said Mrs. Williams.
They lost their business, their reputation.
It's sad."
