President Corazon Aquino today

reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts.
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in November 1986.
Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
Ramos has denied all allegations.
