An emergency Arab League Council failed to

Kuwait's Cabinet affairs minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told reporters he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack.
He accused Iraq of using the "laws of the jungle."
A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied that "they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is against all United Nations and Arab League conventions."
Iraq's ambassador to Egypt, Nabil Najm, sat in until Hamdoon arrived.
MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to "defend Kuwait against the invasion."
All Arab League members also belong to the Islamic conference.
