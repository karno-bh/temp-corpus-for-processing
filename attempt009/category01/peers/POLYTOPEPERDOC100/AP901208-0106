A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut

Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed East German leader for trial could "burden" Bonn and Moscow's "outstanding relations," the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper reported.
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on the manslaughter charges.
He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, outside Berlin.
"I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials," the Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohl's Christian Democrats, as saying.
