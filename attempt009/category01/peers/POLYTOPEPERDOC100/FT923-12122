WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday

as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered stoppages in some 15 of Poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
Polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last year.
