Emperor Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse dropped

Hirohito, 87, discharged more blood and was given emergency transfusions, but was resting peacefully by nightfall, an imperial palace spokesman said.
"The emperor's blood pressure has returned to what is normal for him, and the head court physician says he is not worried," Maeda said.
On Thursday morning, Hirohito's two sons, Crown Prince Akihito and Prince Hitachi, visited him, and he was fully conscious and alert, a senior palace source said.
There was renewed bleeding Thursday and the pace of the discharges was quickening, Maeda said.
