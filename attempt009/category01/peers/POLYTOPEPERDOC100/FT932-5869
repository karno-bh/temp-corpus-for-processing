AS THE value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry

Opening the second McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, along with a 12-storey office block, Mr George Cohon, head of McDonald's Canada, could well be described as the Russian authorities' idea of a model investor.
He also thanked McDonald's for providing jobs, a model of western standards for the country's decrepit service industry, and finally for what he described as 'the most delicious food'.
'It will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants, what happens to the rouble, what happens to raw materials that we buy.
There are too many variables,' said Mr Cohon.
