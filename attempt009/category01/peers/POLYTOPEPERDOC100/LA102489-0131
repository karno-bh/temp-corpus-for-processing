Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session

The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether something might have been done.
There has been no widespread outcry against the governor.
California is on the edge of earthquake-related technology, but still does not know everything that needs to be known.
The state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from Tuesday, Oct. 17.
