East Germany authorities on Friday

interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.
The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke and several border guards would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths.
The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable.
He is staying in a Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill to be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
Mielke was ordered jailed.
