The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly.

In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.
On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be "less carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, adding that the agency "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so.
