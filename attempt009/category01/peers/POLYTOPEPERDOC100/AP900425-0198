After years of delay and a

last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
The shuttle then backed away.
That proved to be unnecessary.
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
"Houston, we see motion," Commander Loren J. Shriver reported.
The race is on.
The clock is ticking."
The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back.
If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
