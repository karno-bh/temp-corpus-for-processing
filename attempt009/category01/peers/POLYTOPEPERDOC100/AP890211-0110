Defense Secretary-designate John Tower

Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did not answer a reporter's calls Saturday.
He said he earned $265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December.
The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the Legal Times said.
The youth was not seriously hurt.
Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was "no question" that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said: "He is not an alcoholic.
He's not had a drinking problem for years."
