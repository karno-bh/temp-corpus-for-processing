East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich

The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, former economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch were under arrest, while the other four remained free.
All three had been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker.
Mielke was arrested on Thursday.
They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were later released because of advanced age and poor health.
