Most Louisiana oil refineries, however, were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday. The cotton and sugar-cane crops were threatened, the state agriculture department said. Several of Louisiana's main industries were affected, including those of oysters and alligators. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was setting aside Dollars 77m to help Louisiana recover. However, local officials in Florida, hit earlier in the week by the hurricane, were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food, drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need.
