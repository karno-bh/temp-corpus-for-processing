Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-majority state in India. The front is one of several Moslem militant groups waging a campaign of bombings and assassinations to press demands for the independence of Kashmir, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state. It was unclear if he was Hindu or Moslem. Moslem militants killed five people who opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday. Mustafa was an independent member of the state legislature. Srinagar has been a focal point of the fighting between government troops and separatists.
