Like Blecha, Gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee. Gratz, who denied the allegations, was also accused of helping Proksch in several other ways. My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated, Gratz told the house. Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean. Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago.
