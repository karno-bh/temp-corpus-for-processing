Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20300 soldiers. The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area. Kuwait and UN diplomats labeled the coup report a farce. The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free Kuwait. The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait. Kuwait's US ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's oil facilities.
