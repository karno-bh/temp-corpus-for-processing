US officials said there was no indication Iraqi troops were preparing to invade Saudi Arabia. Ruling party members said today that the government, fearing a US air attack, was distributing automatic weapons to tens of thousands of supporters and preparing to evacuate the Iraqi capital. A boycott of Iraqi oil forced Baghdad today to close one of two pipelines in Turkey that were pumping the bulk of Iraq's exported oil, Turkish officials said. A British official said Iraqi troops rounded up American and British visitors in Kuwait and taking them to Iraq. President Bush said Iraq was lying.
