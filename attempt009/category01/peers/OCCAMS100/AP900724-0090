The deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 863 since Jan 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists. Indian frontier guards shot and killed 20 Moslem militants and arrested nine others after they sneaked into India-held Kashmir from Pakistan, a senior official said today. Pakistan denies it is training or helping the militants, but says it supports the separatism, terming it a fight for self determination. A total of 80 Moslem militants have died in frontier incidents in the past week.
