He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and embankments. He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized the losses caused by floods. Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government.
