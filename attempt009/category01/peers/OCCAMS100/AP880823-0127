Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors of found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth. At least 131 bodies have been found in the town of 100000. Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
