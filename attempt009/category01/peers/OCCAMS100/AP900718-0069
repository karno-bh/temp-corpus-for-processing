Hindus make up 82 percent of the population. On Tuesday, at least 29 militants were killed by Indian security forces in Kashmir, the Moslem-dominated northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign. The announcement of federal rule reflected the belief that Jammu-Kashmir state was too unstable to be run by an elected local government. The action follows the killing Tuesday of at least 29 Moslem militants by Indian security forces. The government today imposed direct federal rule in Kashmir, where Indian security forces are battling to put down a rebellion by Moslem separatists.
