Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21. That's the key. Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of US sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948. 76 seconds. In that race, she ran 21. 34 seconds, shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat. I know I can run much faster, she said. She glided to the wire.
