And the death toll mounts. Yuan's statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students. Beijing University students said 150 of their fellow students who were in the square are missing. Probably fewer than 10000 people were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to escape unharmed. One Hong Kong newspaper reported 5000 deaths and 30000 injured. He said estimates of the number of dead could go higher. The Chinese government says that 300 soldiers, thugs, bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of Beijing.
