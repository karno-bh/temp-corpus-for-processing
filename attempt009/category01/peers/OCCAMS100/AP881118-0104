Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer. Since Sept 19, when he was confined to intensive care after vomiting blood, Hirohito has received 42 pints of blood in transfusions. Maeda said the emperor's heart and kidneys were functioning normally. Doctors have said he suffers from jaundice and anemia. Hirohito had a temperature of 99. He added that doctors sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake. The emperor responds to queries from aides but is less talkative than before, Maeda told reporters.
