Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of West Side Story, said Bernstein himself played the piano for him during rehearsals. Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestra's first American-born music director. A memorial concert also is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov 14, the 47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut. Leonard Bernstein, whose wide-ranging talents and flamboyant personality helped make him the first American maestro to conquer music's international podium, was buried today alongside his wife. His wife, Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
