In addition to the general wage increase, Mr.  Ramaphosa said the union is demanding a 30%, across-the-board wage increase for black miners, who the union says earn an average of 225 rand ($109) a month. Mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike. The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.
