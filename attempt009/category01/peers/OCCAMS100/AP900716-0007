The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra. Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and will return to the United States to recover, his manager announced today. On Saturday and Sunday, Bernstein canceled appearances with an orchestra of young musicians from the Pacific-Asia region who had been training under principals of the LSO during the three-week Pacific Music Festival in northern Japan. Bernstein inaugurated the festival last month.
