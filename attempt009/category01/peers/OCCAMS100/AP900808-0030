Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on Monday. China joined the UN decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq, but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning the invasion. Japan imports 99 percent of its oil. Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargoes on all trade with both countries. The EEC also suspended arms sales to Iraq. On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
