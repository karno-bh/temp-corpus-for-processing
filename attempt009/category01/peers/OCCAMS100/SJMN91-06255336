; (check) The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a bipartisan group organized in 1963 to assist the government in civil-rights law enforcement, announced that 86 of about 110 members of its board of directors had decided to oppose Thomas' confirmation. About 300 black pastors, representing congregations totaling morethan 1 million churchgoers in 30 states, held a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court and then lobbied their senators to support confirmation of President Bush's Supreme Court nominee. The announcement said Thomas' legal philosophy reflected a hostility to and rejection of the core of civil rights jurisprudence.
