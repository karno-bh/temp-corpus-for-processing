Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper said today. City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind said if Mandela does not make a strong statement in support of Israel, they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations. I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and especially so seen by persons of color, Dinkins told the newspaper in an interview.
