There will not be a coup next week. Lord Wakeham, Leader of the House of Lords, used a letter to his former constituency of Colchester South to issue a general call to Tories for loyalty to Mr Major. John Major is going to lead the Conservative Party successfully into the next general election. Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said: There is no prospect of any leadership contest. But he will be carrying on a 20- to 30-year programme begun in 1979 through to the next general election.
