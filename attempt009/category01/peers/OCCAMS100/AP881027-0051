The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said. The ferry was traveling from Mehendiganj to the island town of Bhola, about 68 miles southeast of Dhaka, when it sank in 22 feet of water. They said about 100 people on the ferry's roof swam to safety but most of those in the hull were unable to save themselves. The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized capacity of 100 passengers, police said.
