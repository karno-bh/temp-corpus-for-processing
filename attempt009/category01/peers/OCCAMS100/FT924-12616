The company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge books and products in the UK. And when Pergamon was sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses. In 1990, through The European newspaper, he sponsored a section of the World Chess championships in New York. 'There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments,' said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge.
