At the moment, the province's flood situation remains very serious, because the water level is still high. Over the past few days, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that some of the province's key dams have remained sound and economic losses have been reduced to a minimum. You have inspected some flood-stricken areas in Changsha City this morning. I'm reporting in Changshanyuan at the eastern gate of Changsha City.
