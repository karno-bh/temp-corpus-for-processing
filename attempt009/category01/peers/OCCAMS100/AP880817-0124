The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military crackdown. Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee, said: We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine workers. A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal, Solidarity officials said. In support of an estimated 3000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.
