The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city. Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines. No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon. For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air. All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport.
