The movies prepared her for television. Lucy was all-American but, equally, a citizen of the world. The irony is that, created by the movies, she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies. The idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or pre-sliced muffins, and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without Lucy's sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne. Lucille Ball was not Lucy, of course. As always, her timing was impeccable.
