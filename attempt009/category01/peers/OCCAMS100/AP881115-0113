The latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty. To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival. The first phase of the study showed that giving people a clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival. The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
