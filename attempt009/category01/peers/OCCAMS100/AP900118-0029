Honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic perspectives, Krenz said of his one-time patron, who for years treated him like a son. Krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years. Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility for the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital. All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through Honecker and Mielke. Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early October, working closely with his then-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.
