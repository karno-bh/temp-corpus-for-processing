Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilberts will be even stronger. You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer, he said. Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded. The greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last year's record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.
