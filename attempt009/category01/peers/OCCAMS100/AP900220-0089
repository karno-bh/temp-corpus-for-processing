The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir. The leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely. The nations have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state, in 1948 and again in 1965. Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said.
