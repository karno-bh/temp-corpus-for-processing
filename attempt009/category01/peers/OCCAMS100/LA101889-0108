I walked into the stadium to interview fans. My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening. And again, I sensed little panic. A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long. I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit. I opened the door to the trailer and looked out. It was shortly after the network went on the air.
