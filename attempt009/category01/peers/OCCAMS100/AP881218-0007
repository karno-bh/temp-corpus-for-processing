The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned. The Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for inland water navigation, announced in August it had begun an investigation into the safety of China's river vessels to determine if standards should be tightened. The 183 passengers and four crew members enormously exceeded the ferry's capacity and the ship capsized Wednesday before it had sailed 200 yards, the report said.
