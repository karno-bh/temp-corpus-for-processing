There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking County in central Ohio. Thunderstorms swept through central and eastern Ohio, causing flooding that killed at least ten people, left dozens missing and forced hundreds of others from their homes, officials said today. Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4300 people overflowed when about 4 inches of rain fell Thursday night in about an hour. It created a wall of water, said Jim Williams of the Ohio Emergency Management Agency. The problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find.
