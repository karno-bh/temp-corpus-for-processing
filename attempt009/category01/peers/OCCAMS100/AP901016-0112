It is Britain's top literary award. The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust.  Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist Margaret Drabble. The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the $39000 prize to Antonia Byatt for Possession, one of six finalists in the 21-year-old competition. Critic and novelist AS Byatt on Tuesday won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets.
