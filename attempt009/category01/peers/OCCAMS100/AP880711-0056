The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world. If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further. As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.
