Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose bodies were found in remote areas on Wednesday. The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of Nepal and found more bodies. In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people. It may be the second coming.
