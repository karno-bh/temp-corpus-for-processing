The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit. The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the same trial in 1964. The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas. Four imprisoned African National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela, were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison house, an activist said today.
