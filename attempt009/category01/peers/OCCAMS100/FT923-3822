The judges will have to rule on the characterisation of the European protagonists who go off to found a Utopia in Florida. The shipboard detail - the horrors of the trade -are brilliantly done. Lots of action in the kitchen; something is hidden in the cellar. The surprise contender because it is not yet published. He is the novelist of misanthropy. The Prize (courtesy of Booker plc, the food and agri-business group) is no longer the richest literary award but it guarantees great prestige, and sales, for the winner, and, say its admirers, helpfully brings The Novel to public attention.
