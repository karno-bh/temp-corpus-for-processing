The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor. THE INDIAN government flew federal paramilitary troops into Bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city, killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand. One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which most victims were Moslems. All exploded within 90 minutes in the afternoon.
