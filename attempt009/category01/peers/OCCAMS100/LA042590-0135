It is the third flight for Hawley, 38. All five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights. Sadly, some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch. But it will still represent a historic moment. The image, of a cluster of stars in the southern sky, will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase, so it may not even be in focus. The launch marked the beginning of an era -- some say a revolution -- in the exploration of the universe.
