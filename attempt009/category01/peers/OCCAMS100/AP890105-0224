The nomination is subject to Senate approval. President-elect Bush designated Tower as his defense secretary on Dec 16. After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant. When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed. The senator is expected to make a full recovery. Senator Tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition, hospital spokesman Steve Habgood said Thursday night.  John Tower, the defense secretary-designate, underwent surgery Thursday to remove a colon polyp, a hospital spokesman said.
