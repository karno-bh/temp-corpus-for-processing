In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections. On 28 June 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the PivdennoDonbass mine of the Donetskvuhillya production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons -- delay in paying wages. After a meeting with the mine's director, who promised to pay the arrears, the miners on the third shift returned to work.
