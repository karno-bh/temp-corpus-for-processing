The stage was adorned with a painting of Lennon and life-size cardboard cutouts of the Fab Four in front of the British flag. Their music was banned and the Soviet press condemned them. The celebration was a dramatic turnabout from Soviet authorities' repression of Beatles fans and supression of their music in earlier times. State radio broadcast his music and interviews about him. Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have turned 50 on Tuesday.
