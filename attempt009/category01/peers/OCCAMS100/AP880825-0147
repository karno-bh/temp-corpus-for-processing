The parents of a Peace Corps worker learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in that country and neighboring India. Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down all but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal. The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the family had had of her safety. We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains, Flanigan said. There are no Peace Corps members in India, he said.
