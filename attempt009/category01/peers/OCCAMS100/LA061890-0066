The dams broke under the water pressure. Officials also learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the area. The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River. Eighteen people remained missing. Twenty-three dog teams from four states were searching for victims. Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge. That left 18 still missing, Vogt said. Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more.
