West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that the way is now free for German reunification. West Germany's Social Democratic Party is expected to campaign heavily in East Germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls. And after the election, he said, they will want to put their programs into practice quickly. His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Political and economic union go hand in hand, Kohl said.
