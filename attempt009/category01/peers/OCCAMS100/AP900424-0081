It really gets to you. This is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief.  Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's astrometry project leader. There were times when we were elated about Hubble's progress, said William H. There were times when we were deeply depressed. The power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power, Norman said. It was incredibly beautiful. Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope Science Institute there, called the launch the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind.
