The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the South American mainland Sunday. There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings. The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known. The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p. Tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. No injuries were reported in the sinking.
