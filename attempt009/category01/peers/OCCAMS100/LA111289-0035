Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well. Normally, a vice president would not be. He went on Meet the Press. The show was uneventful. His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news. But Quayle was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up.

And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that. Sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious.
