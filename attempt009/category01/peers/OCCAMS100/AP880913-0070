Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland. A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene. The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds. The ship sank at about 12:45 p. A freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman said.
