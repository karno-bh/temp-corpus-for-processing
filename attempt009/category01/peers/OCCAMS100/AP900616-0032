One young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins lost in the flood, the sheriff said. He said he was pleased with the assistance of young people. At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called in to patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency. Small tractors and four-wheel-drive vehicles were the only means of transportation in much of the stricken area. Cars were mired roof-deep in mud, and guardrails and chunks of concrete were torn from roads. I was one of the lucky ones.
