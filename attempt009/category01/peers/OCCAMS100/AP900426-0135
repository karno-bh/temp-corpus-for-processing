The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown. Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina. It's a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause. This time it was a pointing problem, said Jim Elliott, a Goddard spokesman.  when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain antennas through the TDRS.
