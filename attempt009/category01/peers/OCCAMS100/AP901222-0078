I was having a hard time staying up in the water. Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescue boat and hit by a second. Benjamin said he dove from the ferry, then had to swim frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat. One rescue boat, already overloaded, passed by and threw life preservers. Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big wave. At least 19 sailors drowned, and scores were injured.
