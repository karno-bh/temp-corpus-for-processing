The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11000 subjects taking the substitute. Overall death rates for the two groups were the same, though the aspirin group's nonfatal heart-attack rate was much lower. A study published in January indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal, first heart attacks 47% in 11000 male doctors over five years, compared with 11000 who took a non-aspirin substitute.
