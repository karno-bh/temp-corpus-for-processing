Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is very similar to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976. The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar. The academy said it would appeal. Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling comes as a shock to me.
