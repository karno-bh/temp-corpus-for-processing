Greece won independence in 1830. Greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath the Aegean Sea and back into history, finding a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in 1822. The remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a diver and salvage expert. The Bourloti Seimaz _ or Explosives Invincible _ was set afire and sunk by Greek Admiral Constantine Kanaris in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios.
