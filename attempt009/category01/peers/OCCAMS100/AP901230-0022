Moldavia, acting to defuse one of the Soviet Union's most explosive ethnic conflicts, agreed Sunday to comply with a Kremlin order to reconsider its law making Moldavian the republic's official language. All three groups claim discrimination by Moldavians. Gorbachev also gave the republic 10 days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders. Alarmed by rising Moldavian nationalism, two of the republic's minority groups have begun their own separatist movements. The Moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void.
