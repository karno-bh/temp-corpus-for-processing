Pakistan denies it. Moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training, police said. A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24 hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants. India itself is overwhelmingly Hindu. The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state.
