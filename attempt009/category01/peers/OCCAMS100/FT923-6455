Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage.
