The United States has warned Iraq against any attack on Saudi Arabia, and President Bush has said all options are open for the United States. The Iraqi-installed Kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that they should not forget their citizens in Kuwait while heaping on economic punishments, and today's roundup appeared to be a reaction against the sanctions. Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait, as the UN Security Council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading the emirate.
