Lennon was 40.  Ono had suffered. The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club, made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has become a place of pilgrimage.  Ono and the couple's son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary privately. Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning to their apartment in New York's Dakota apartment building after a recording session on Dec 8, 1980, when Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman, a deranged fan to whom Lennon had given his autograph only hours before.
