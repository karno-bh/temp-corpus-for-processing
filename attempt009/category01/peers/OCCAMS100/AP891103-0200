The miners say the government has renedged on its promises. Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social and economic conditions. The miners's unions said the decision will be appealed. The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions. Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
