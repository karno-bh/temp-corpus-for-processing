Moslems make up 64 percent of the state population of 5 million. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state with a Moslem majority in predominantly Hindu India. India has often accused Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri militants, a charge Pakistan has denied. The Jammu region is predominantly Hindu. Parts of Kashmir region are claimed by both India and Pakistan. Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said.
