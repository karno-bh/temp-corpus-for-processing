Among them are Georgia's war with Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed. Scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several days. The troops were sent to halt fighting between Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes.
