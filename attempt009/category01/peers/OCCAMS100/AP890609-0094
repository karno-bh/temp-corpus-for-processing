packed a Chinatown park this morning in a memorial service for students slain by soldiers in Tiananmen Square. After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese funeral bier containing fruit and incense. More than 5000 people chanting Freedom will survive. As they headed up Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked beneath a 30-foot black banner strung across the road. Demonstrators planned another rally later in the day outside the United Nations. The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown, tying up traffic.
