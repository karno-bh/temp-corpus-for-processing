The end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom. Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable. The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations. Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history.
