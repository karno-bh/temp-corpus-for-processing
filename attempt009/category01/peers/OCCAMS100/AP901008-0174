A management committee of authors, booksellers, librarians and the sponsors chooses a jury of five: a writer or two, an academic, a politician interested in literature and a literary editor or critic. The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the prize. The prize to the author is a check for 20000 pounds (nearly $38000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business. The Booker Prize is Britain's literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct 16, and dinner in London's ancient Guildhall.
