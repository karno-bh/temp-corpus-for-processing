 de Klerk meets Mandela for the first time. August, 1988 Mandela contracts tuberculosis and is transferred to a hospital.  Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence; Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and grants full political rights to blacks. April-June 1964 Mandela and seven others are sentenced to life in prison. When the National Party comes to power in 1948, the ANC begins planning a campaign of civil disobedience to fight the party's apartheid policy. In a short time, the ANC becomes the force behind black protests.
