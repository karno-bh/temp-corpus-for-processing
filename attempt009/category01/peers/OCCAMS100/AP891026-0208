After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith. Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel The Remains of the Day, judges announced Thursday. He writes in English. The prize is worth $32000. Rushdie lives in England. Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English vacation, as a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance.
