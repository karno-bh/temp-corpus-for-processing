An official of the Indian border security force, which normally patrols the border, said the Indian army today took control of the cease-fire line. The two demonstrations at the cease-fire line were to express support for Moslem militants who are fighting for independence for the Moslem-dominated state from the predominantly Hindu India. A fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the Indian and Pakistani Kashmirs. A Pakistani official in Islamabad denied the accusations. The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled Kashmir from the Indian-held region.
