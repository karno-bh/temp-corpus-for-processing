 Kulazenka said. The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near Moundsville, WVa. The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when a thunderstorm rolled through the area. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River, said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator. The death toll from last week's flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
