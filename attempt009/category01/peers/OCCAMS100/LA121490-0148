The audience responded with a sustained standing ovation. Michael Wager, a very close friend of Bernstein's who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy.   -- a work the composer often spoke of wanting to revise. Winging in from the West Coast (as was Walker) was Lauren Bacall, who teamed up with Phyllis Newman for a sly rendition of Ohio from Bernstein's Wonderful Town. Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of West Side Story, sang a medley of I Feel Pretty and Tonight.
