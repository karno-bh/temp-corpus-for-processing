President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines sent condolences to the imperial family and her foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised Hirohito as a stabilizing factor in the creation of a democratic Japan. During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent period in Japan's modern history to the stability and prosperity of today, Lange said. We may not want to collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful historic lessions. Now, Hirohito has died.  Chinese suffered the most from the Japanese invasion.
