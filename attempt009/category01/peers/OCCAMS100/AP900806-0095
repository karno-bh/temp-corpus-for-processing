The provisional government said countries have to remember they have interests and citizens in Kuwait. The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms shipments to Iraq. The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community. The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.
