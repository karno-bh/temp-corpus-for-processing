Lennon was slain on Dec 8, 1980, when he was 40. Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death in front of his apartment in New York City. The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing Imagine, while giant screens showed a video featuring John and Yoko. The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcast worldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decade after his death.
