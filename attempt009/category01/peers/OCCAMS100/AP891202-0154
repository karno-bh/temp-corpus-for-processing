Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, There is much to work with there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the (NATO) alliance. There has been speculation that West Germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the Kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.  Lugar, head of the American delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl. Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting US senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
