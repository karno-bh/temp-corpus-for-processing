Laurel said the coup occurred because Aquino failed to unite the nation or the armed forces, leading to divided loyalties and fragmentation. These are the reformist elements, he said. Laurel criticized Aquino for asking the United States to help bolster her beleaguered forces Friday. He called the group his party's junta, but said they have no ties to the rebels. Laurel said he was in London early Friday when the Philippine fighting began.  Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels have the right to try to seize power.
