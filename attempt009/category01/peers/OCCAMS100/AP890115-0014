Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed the heart. 5 million Americans will have heart attacks this year. Experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits, including fewer cigarettes and better food, and improved medical treatment. About 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital. It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal heart ailment. The association's figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it.
