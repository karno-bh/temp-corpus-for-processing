Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about 3180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state, the tax office official said. Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings. Akihito has paid $2. He was succeeded by Akihito, his eldest son. Until the end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods. It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
