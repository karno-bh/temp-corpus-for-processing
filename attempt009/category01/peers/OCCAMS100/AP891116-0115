Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by the time the twister hit. Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or cars. No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters were in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were reported injured. The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warning Wednesday afternoon as the city's streets grew busy with the approach of rush hour. The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in an arc spanning at least seven states from the Deep South to the Midwest.
