If two rings of the Bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music, the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life. He made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses. Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra, often joining his New York Philharmonic in playing his own pieces, while conducting from the piano. He was 72. Leonard Bernstein, the Renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist, composer, conductor and teacher and was, as well, the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment.
