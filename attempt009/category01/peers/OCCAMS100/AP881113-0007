A South African government source last week indicated recent rumors of Mandela's impending release were orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action. Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government. He was transferred from prison to a hospital in August for treatment of tuberculosis. Mandela the 70-year-old leader of the ANC jailed 27 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the South African government.
