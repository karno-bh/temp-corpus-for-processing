I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage, Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special. She was on his radio show on May 27, 1947, at Detroit. Our last time together in public was at the Academy Awards in March. The last time she was on my show was my birthday show two years ago. In fact, the late Desi Arnaz, her then husband, worked for Hope first. Lucy was a very funny woman, Hope said. It's called Bob Hope's Love Affair With Lucille Ball.
