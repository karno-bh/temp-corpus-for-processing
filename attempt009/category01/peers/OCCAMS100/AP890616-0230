Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations. More than 10000 coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group. Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathy strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late Thursday.
