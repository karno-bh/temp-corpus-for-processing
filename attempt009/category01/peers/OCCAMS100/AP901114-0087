The orchestra played the overture to Bernstein's Candide with a symbolically empty podium, which brought tears to some of the invited audience and a standing ovation. Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett, Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine. On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his Mass and Chichester Psalms. Two pieces by Copland were played. Wednesday's midday concert at Carnegie Hall also came on the 90th birthday of the late composer-conductor's close friend, Aaron Copland.
