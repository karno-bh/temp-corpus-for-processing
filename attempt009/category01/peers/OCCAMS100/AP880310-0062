The Pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious Westminister Kennel Club Show in Madison Square Garden last month. With no seats and no food for the guests of honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardi's had gone to the dogs. Two dogs, to be specific, the city's top police dog and the nation's top show dog. The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd. Nero specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
