The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8. The board has approved the proposal. Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL. The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim, Aghjayan said. The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday.
