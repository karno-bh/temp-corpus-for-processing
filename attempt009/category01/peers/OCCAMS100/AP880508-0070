A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students. South Africa's white-minority government says it will free Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country. The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's family to get their approval.
