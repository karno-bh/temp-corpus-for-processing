In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television said steel and coke-chemical plants were on the verge of a stoppage for lack of coal. But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in the Ukraine. The government has acknowledged that living and working conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made general pledges of improvements. By evening, 14 mines in the region, home of the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at a standstill. Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia today refused to work, Tass said.
