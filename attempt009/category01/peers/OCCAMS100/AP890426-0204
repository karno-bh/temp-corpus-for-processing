Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny. The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral. Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program My Favorite Husband, which later became I Love Lucy on television. They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived Life With Lucy. The world will miss her greatly, the actor said.
