Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions. Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union, Tass said.  Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms.
