There was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake. 5 quake within 30 years. The report said the 50-mile segment had a 20 percent likelihood of producing a magnitude-7 quake within 30 years. The bigger a quake, the more stress it relieves, and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again. The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday.
