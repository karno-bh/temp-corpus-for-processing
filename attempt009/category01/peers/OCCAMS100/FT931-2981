Among the targets were the Bombay Stock Exchange, the landmark Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport. The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay. INDIA suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of Calcutta, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores of others.
