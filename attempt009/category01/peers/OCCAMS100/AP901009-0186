We all want peace, whatever sort of job we have. John Lennon's worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song Imagine was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday. More than 1000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries broadcast the 10-minute event. A dream we dream alone is only a dream, but the dream we dream together is reality. Lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his Manhattan apartment building on Dec 8, 1980.
