Like Rebecca, the popular novel by du Maurier's granddaughter, it is a natural equivalent of what the current Booker Prize seeks to create: a combination of the classic and the bestseller. Culturally, these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream, and the novel was their political and intellectual forum. The idea of a two-tier, up and down-market, fiction was irrelevant. The Victorians, in contrast, were lovers of contemporary fiction. Before the short-list was announced it sold 10600. First, the similarities. But the retrospective Booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction.
