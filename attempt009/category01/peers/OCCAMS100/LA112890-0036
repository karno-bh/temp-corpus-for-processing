The Labor Party, almost overnight, went from being the strong favorite in the next election to second place behind a Tory party led by Major. But Major was the clear-cut victor in the balloting, held from 11 a. That in a sense was true. The Labor Party had expected to defeat an unpopular Thatcher in the next election. His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next general election. Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century.
