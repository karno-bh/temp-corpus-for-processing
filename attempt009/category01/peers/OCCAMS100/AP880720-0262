All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund, and to a fund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors. Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Center class of 1940, where he became a protege of Tanglewood founder Serge Koussevitzky. But the highlight of the new season is the celebration of Bernstein's birthday. Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a movement from Bernstein's Symphony No. The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day affair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug 25, to raise money for the music center.
