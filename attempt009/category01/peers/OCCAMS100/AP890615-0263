He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer. Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash registers. Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot. He shook their hands and talked to everyone he could. People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him, said store manager Paul Sively.
