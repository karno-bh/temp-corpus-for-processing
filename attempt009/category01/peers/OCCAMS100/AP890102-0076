Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic development mission in Guatemala, the embassy said. A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are missing, authorities and news reports said today. Gaytan said navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and private craft have been searching the bay for survivors and recovering bodies. Besides Daudi, the nationalities of the victims were not immediately known. Puerto Barrios, 187 miles northeast of the capital, is Guatemala's principal east coast port. He said he had no other details on the shipwreck.
