The concert was broadcast nationally on radio. Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra. And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three Bernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well. Will this birthday never end. At intermission, Mrs. Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night. Bernstein gave bear hugs to all nine.
