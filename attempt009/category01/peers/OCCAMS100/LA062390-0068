Meanwhile, other US groups were rushing to supply Iran with emergency goods. Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it. Andy Griffel, executive director of American Jewish World Service, said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call Friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the Iranian victims. Confronted with reports that Iran would not welcome assistance from Israel, the groups were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance. Late Thursday, the Iranian Red Crescent appealed for help from the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society, a Geneva-based umbrella for international humanitarian organizations.
