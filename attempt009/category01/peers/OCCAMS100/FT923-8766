Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, I watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions. TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held. It is also without doubt the most gruelling. Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run. There are lots of figures to show why.
