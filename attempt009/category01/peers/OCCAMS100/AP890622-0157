Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the property of the German people. The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie. Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece, Ballard said. Of the Bismarck's 2200-man crew, only about 115 survived. The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance. Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize, he added.
