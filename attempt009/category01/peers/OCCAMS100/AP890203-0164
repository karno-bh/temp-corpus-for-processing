President Bush congratulated the San Francisco 49ers on Friday and said they rewrote the record books with their Super Bowl victory. The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in Miami. Remember the Redskin fans are all around us. Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award. Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, With this, your third Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.
