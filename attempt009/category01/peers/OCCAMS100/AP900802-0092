Kuwaiti spokesman Nasser Al-Sabeeh said before the formal meeting that Kuwait wants negotiations with Iraq to be mediated by the Arab League. The Iraqi invasion posed a breach of international peace and security, the Security Council said. The Security Council resolution said the council supports all efforts for negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait. Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan, denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new government. The Security Council resolution was adopted 14-0 in an emergency session requested by the United States and Kuwait hours after today's pre-dawn invasion.
