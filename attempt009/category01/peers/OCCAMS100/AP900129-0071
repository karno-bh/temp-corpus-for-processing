Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital. East Germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out corruption and abuse of office. Honecker, 77, was detained after his release from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor, the official ADN news agency said. Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker was arrested and taken to prison today, and a prosecutor said he will tried for high treason in March.
