Bild said Mielke and other members of Honecker's ruling circle will be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification on Oct 3. One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked for Mielke's Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief. Mielke remains in custody. He was one of Honecker's closest aides. East Germany's ousted secret police chief threatened to break former Communist leader Erich Honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail, a West German newspaper reported Wednesday.
