To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero. He had time for everybody. But he had planned on working with him again. The highlight of my career. But in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono. The music was mostly mainstream pop; no 18-minute jams or political anthems. That working class hero thing, he was trying to be real about that. It was more than a superstar session. Dear Yoko and Grow Old With Me were tributes to his wife.
