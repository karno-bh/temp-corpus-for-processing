Honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together. A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday. A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on the manslaughter charges. He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall. He has taken refuge at a Soviet military hospital in Beelitz, outside Berlin.
