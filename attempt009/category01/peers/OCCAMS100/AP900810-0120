East Germany authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country. The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable. Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power. Mielke was ordered jailed. He is staying in a Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
