Bernstein was once a heavy smoker. He conducted his first symphony, the Jeremiah, with the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1944.  Cahill attributed the problem to emphysema complicated by a tumor and pulmonary infections. His first published composition was The Clarinet Sonata in 1942. He has conducted 1244 New York Philharmonic concerts, more than any other conductor. We all will be less for the loss of his magic baton. Bernstein, known for his vigorous style at the podium, once led an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp. Bernstein is not hospitalized.
