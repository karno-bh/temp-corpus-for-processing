The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met to implement the final solution against Europe's Jewish population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference on German reunification. In fact, he said, reunification might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings. Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be blaming the Jews for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained. The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration on German reunification will be issued May 8. Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism once the two Germanys are united.
