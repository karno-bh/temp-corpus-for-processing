India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire. Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India that is dominated by Moslems. Witnesses estimated the crowd at 40000. At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists. The body of a suspected police informer was found in Srinagar, and officials said militants claimed responsibility.
