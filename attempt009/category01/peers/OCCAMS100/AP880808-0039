Chand said his father and uncle were aboard the ferry. The women and children suffered the worst. The ferry was designed to carry about 160 people, but was was always overcrowded, he said. We are planning to break the ferry. Authorities said the water was still rising and the submerged boat was sinking in the river bed. The water is too muddy.
