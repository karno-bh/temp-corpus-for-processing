NBC News reported Friday that the exact cause of the explosion may never be known because the devastation inside the turret was so complete. Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to a report in today's editions of The Washington Post. Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47 sailors who died on the USS Iowa as victims of a tragedy that reaches into little towns all over the country.
