In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the northern part of the square. Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers. The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change. Buses and bicyclists today were allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of the square.
