The Star of Alexandria was built in 1966, and was registered in England. The Star of Alexandria was not spotted, and was presumed to be sinking or sunk, Midgett said. The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said. The lifeboat was spotted around noon. The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York. Twenty-three crew members were rescued.
