As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses. There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. Sunday's earthquake registered 6. In India, the official count rose to 277. Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims.
