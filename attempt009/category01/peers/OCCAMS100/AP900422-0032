Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but were delayed by the Challenger accident. Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. The first time was in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger exploded. 6 miles from Discovery. Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time, Leinbach said. Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.
