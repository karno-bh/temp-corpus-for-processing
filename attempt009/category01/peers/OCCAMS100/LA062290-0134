About 25000 people died in eastern Iran in a 1978 earthquake. The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland. Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25000 people dead in northern Iran. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day period of mourning for quake victims. The country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years. The report said that many people fled into the streets.
