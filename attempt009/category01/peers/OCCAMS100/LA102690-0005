Bernstein raised the baton for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, emotional at any time, but never more so than for a people engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The audience was a mix of black-tie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues. With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evening's performance of the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor. Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer in the Israeli army during the country's War of Independence.
