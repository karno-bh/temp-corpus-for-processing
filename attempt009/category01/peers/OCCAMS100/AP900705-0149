In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta. A natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack, according to a study published in the journal Science. TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack, said Dr.  Lefer, a professor at Jefferson.
