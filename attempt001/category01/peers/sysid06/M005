The United States Geological Survey first reported it reached a preliminary magnitude of 5.5, and the epicenter was located very close to Pichilemu, a coastal town in the O'Higgins Region.
The University of Chile Geological Survey reported the epicenter of the earthquake was located 28 kilometers at the south of Pichilemu, and it is most likely an aftershock to the March 11 earthquake.
Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened," reported El Rancagüino, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February 28.
According to the University of Chile, it had a magnitude of 5.6, and occurred 32 kilometers south of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region at a depth of 41.9 kilometers.
The United States Geological Survey, however, reported that the earthquake had a magnitude of 5.4, and that it occurred at a depth of 35 kilometers, 60 kilometers northwest of Curicó, Maule Region.
