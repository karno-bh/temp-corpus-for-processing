The Olympic torch relay in San Francisco, California, began today at 1:00 p.m. PDT (UTC-7). 
Around 25 arrests have been made by Metropolitan Police officers, during the 31 mile Olympic Torch relay in London, England. 
It began at 8:00 P.M. China Standard Time (UTC+8), and took place at the Beijing National Stadium. 
The route ends at the O2 Arena after being carried by around 80 athletes, dignitaries and entertainers. 
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declared the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games closed on Sunday. 
It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the 2008 Summer Olympics. 
At the governmental level, Ming-tung Chen mentioned that people in Taiwan do not accept the request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols, and the National Song of the Republic of China, based on the cross-strait common consensus on February 12, 2007. 
The IOC finally announced yesterday that the torch's route will not cross Taiwan. 
The torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. 
The torch continued its route, surrounded by more than twenty security officers, to be seen by hundreds of spectators, and continued verbal protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in China. 
A lawyer of CIPFG said that Mass Media in Taiwan didn't revealed the truth of oppressing human rights in Mainland China and promoted Beijing 2008 with "We Are Ready" slogan.
