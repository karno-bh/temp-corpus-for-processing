The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali is nearing its halfway mark. 
The European Union would not view it as necessary to attend the major emitters meeting (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the climate change conference in Bali. 
This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. 
The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. 
A bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25 - 40% cut in GHG emissions. 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too "ambitious" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming. 
It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020. 
While the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. 
Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea. 
After the United States agreed to the changes proposed by India this morning, the so called Bali Roadmap has been agreed on, to applause from all parties.
