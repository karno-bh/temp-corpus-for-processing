The Brazilian Air Force has located bodies and wreckage of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean. 
Wreckage from an airplane in the Atlantic Ocean 650 kilometres from the coast of Brazil has been confirmed by the Brazilian government to be from Air France Flight 447. 
Air France flight 447, traveling from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, disappeared on June 1 over the Atlantic Ocean. 
Air France Flight 447 was an Airbus A330 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, with 228 people on board. 
The Airbus A330 had departed from Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, with a dozen crew members and 216 passengers on board. 
The Airbus A330-200 was last heard via radio at 22:30 local time. 
A wooden cargo pallet and two buoys had been recovered, but are now believed to have been from a ship. 
The Brazilian defence minister said that it may be hard to find them due to the large depth of the ocean in the area, saying that "it could be at a depth of 2,000 or 3,000 metres (6,500 to 9,800 feet) in that area of the ocean." 
Search teams from Brazil mainly focused on the area north of Fernando de Noronha, an island located approximately two hundred miles off the coast of Brazil. 
The search is still underway for the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes. 
An airplane seat and life vest were found floating in Atlantic waters on Tuesday.
