In January 2005, a United States Army court martial proceeding found Army Spc. Charles Graner guilty of abusing prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison. 
U.S. Lt. Col. Steven Lee Jordan will be tried by a military court for his involvement in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse case. 
The operation of Abu Ghraib will be transferred to the government of Iraq. 
In addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were part of the series of abuses. 
The Pentagon has confirmed the authenticity of the images aired by Australian television network SBS. 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld testified that not all known photographs of the abuses at Abu Ghraib had been publicly released at the Senate Armed Services Committee inquiry in May 2004. 
U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein strongly disagreed, saying that suppressing the pictures amounts to submitting to blackmail. 
The jury sentenced Graner to ten years in prison. 
John Sifton, researcher at Human Rights Watch said "Soldiers were told that the Geneva Conventions did not apply, and that interrogators could use abusive techniques to get detainees to talk." 
A report is published by Human Rights Watch on treatment of prisoners in Iraq by US soldiers after the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. 
Pictures of extensive detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib taken inside the prison in November 2003 had been released earlier this year. 
Gen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial involving two dog-handlers who are accused of detainee abuse.
