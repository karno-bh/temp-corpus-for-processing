The death toll from the earthquake and tsunamis that has hit countries in Asia and Eastern Africa continues to rise, passing 80,000 people according to reports from several news agencies.
Near the epicenter of the earthquakes and tsunami, Indonesia's Aceh province alone may have as many as 80,000 death.
Several prominent Romanian artists and celebrities will gather at the Radio Hall in Bucharest on Sunday, January 23, to raise money for the victims of the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004.
Romanian Artists in Support of Asia is the second major public event organised in Romania to support the victims of the recent Indian Ocean disaster.
The Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money.
Up to four times as many women as men died in the December 26 Indian Ocean Tsunami, figures published by Oxfam International today reveal.
Another factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.
According to new information about the earthquake of December 26, 2004, it was the longest-lasting earthquake ever recorded.
This quake released an amount of energy equal to a 100 gigaton bomb, according to Roger Bilham, professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado.
