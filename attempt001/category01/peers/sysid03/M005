Another large aftershock of the February 27 8.8 earthquake — of 6.5 magnitude — rocked Chile earlier on Wednesday, the USGS reported.
Eight months after a catastrophic earthquake, Wikinews has investigated the devastation caused in February and the reconstruction of Pichilemu, Chile.
The February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages.
The Agustín Ross architecture in the city (three of his buildings are National Monuments of Chile) was damaged.
As of October 23, four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed.
The first shaking took place at 00:37 local time (03:37 UTC), which according to the University of Chile Seismological Service had a 4.7 magnitude in the Richter scale.
The second tremor took place at 02:21 local time (05:21 UTC), 18 kilometers southwest of Rancagua, O'Higgins Region at a depth of 90.8 kilometers.
According to the University of Chile, it had a magnitude of 5.6, and occurred 32 kilometers south of Pichilemu, O'Higgins Region at a depth of 41.9 kilometers.
This movement was felt across the Valparaíso, Santiago Metropolitan, O'Higgins, Maule, and Bío Bío Regions, in cities such as Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Santiago Centro, San Fernando, Curicó, Talca, Constitución, Talcahuano, Cauquenes, and Concepción.
