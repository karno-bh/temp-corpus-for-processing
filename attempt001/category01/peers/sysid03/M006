The survivors from the recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti are now facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons, officials have cautioned, even as aid is flowing into the country.
Haitian police yesterday arrested ten United States nationals, five men and five women, over the alleged abduction of 33 children.
Senior Pastor Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church told reporters New Life Children's Refuge, and the Haiti mission, are separate from the 25-year-old church.
The United States government will resume evacuation flights for injured Haitians following doctors advising that many were likely to die if they did not receive immediate medical care.
Ten United States missionaries who tried to take 33 Haitian children out the country last week without the governmentâ€™s consent have been charged with child kidnapping and criminal association for illegally trying to take children out of Haiti.
Their claimed intention was to move the quake victims to a temporary orphanage being set up at a hotel-resort in the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
Police said the Americans did not have paperwork, nor permissions, to remove the children from the country.
As reported the United Nations, January 12 Haiti earthquake left exactly 222,570 deaths, 1,300,000 refugees in harbours, 766,000 displaced people, 310,000 injured and 869 disappeared.
