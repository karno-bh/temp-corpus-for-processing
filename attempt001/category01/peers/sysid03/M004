At the U.N. conference on Global Climate change in Bali, the early talk has focused on whether some of the major developed countries will commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years.
The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon says setting greenhouse-gas emission targets may have to wait until after the U.N.
Stavros Dimas at a press conference today stated that the European Union would not view it as necessary to attend the major emitters meeting (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the climate change conference in Bali.
The EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming.
After the United States agreed to the changes proposed by India this morning, the so called Bali Roadmap has been agreed on, to applause from all parties.
The climate conference that was held for the last two weeks in Bali came to a conclusion on Saturday.
The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement.
This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things.
Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change.
