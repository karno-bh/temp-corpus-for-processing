The Metropolitan Police released two photographs at 15:30 today as a result of an intense investigation into London bomb attacks of last week.
Police at Scotland Yard have discovered that the suicide bombers who mounted an attack on London on July 7th had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier.
Survivors of the London Bombings have urged the British public to write to their MPs, and set up an online petition calling for an independent Public Inquiry into the attacks.
Five men were found guilty Monday for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out bombings in the UK.
Three of the July 7 bombers, Mohammed Siddique Khan, Shezhad Tanweer and Jermaine Lindsay, were shown in the video, although the other bomber, Hasib Hussain, was not seen in the video.
The July 7 bombings were a series of coordinated bombings which struck London on the morning of July 7, 2005.
A permanent memorial for the victims of the July 7, 2005 London bombings has been unveiled in Hyde Park, London, England.
Today is the fourth anniversary of the bombings, when 52 people were killed by suicide bombers on board three Underground trains and a bus.
52 stainless steel columns standing 3.5m (11.5ft) tall were inaugurated in the presence of Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla Bowles, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Minister for London, Tessa Jowell.
