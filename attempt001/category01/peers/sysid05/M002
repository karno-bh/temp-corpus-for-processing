The Iranian government initially gave the location of the incident as being inside Iraqi waters.  After comments from the UK government, Iran gave a revised position for the incident, and the new position provided by the Iranians was outside Iraqi waters and within Iranian territorial waters.  The Iranian government then stated that it was not the first time that British ships had entered Iranian waters.   Triesman indicated that meetings have taken place with Iranian officials over the release of the seized British sailors, and that "they're delicate discussions." Reports also say that the sailors are being held until five Iranian guards, detained in Iraq by the United States early in 2007, are released to the Iranian government.   "I hope we manage to get them [the Iranian government] to realize they have to release them.  According to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, the female sailor will "be released very soon," but did not state when the other 14 sailors and marines would be released.   Iran claims the UK forces were in Iranian waters, and are still detaining the fifteen. Iranian media said that the British sailors 'shouted for joy' at the news.   Iran says they were in Iranian territorial waters while the UK insists they were operating in Iraqi waters under the terms of a UN mandate.   Six other Iranian boats arrived.  Some of the Iranian sailors were becoming deliberately aggressive and unstable.
