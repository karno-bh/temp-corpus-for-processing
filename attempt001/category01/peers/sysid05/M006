"They reported structures down.  "The United States is offering our full assistance to Haiti and to others in the region.  Survivors are using their hands to help get trapped people out.  "I saw dead bodies, people are screaming, they are on the street panicking, people are hurt.  Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties," Ban stated.   "People are still very traumatised here," said a reporter for the Al Jazeera news agency who was in Haiti when the aftershock struck.  Officials estimate the initial earthquake killed about 200,000 people and affected three million â€” about a third of Haiti's population.  We do not have any reports of damage yet."   According to Elizabeth Byrs, the UN spokeswoman, 132 people have been rescued since the earthquake hit.  It's also the only way to avoid the same problems happening in Haiti again."   "At night, people take things.  An earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.0, struck Haiti on January 12, killing as much as 200,000 people and largely destroying the capital Port-au-Prince; another million have been left without homes. Later, three people arrived at the SOS Children's village claiming to be relatives of five of the children.  Lots of children have been affected by the earthquake.   I don't see any reason why they should be tried in the United States."
