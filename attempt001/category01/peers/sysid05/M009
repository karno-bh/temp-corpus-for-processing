After the evening declaration of the "Global Human Rights Torch Relay", CIPFG and Epochtimes Global will launch "World Human Rights" Web and still promote "Global Human Rights Torch Relay" for accepting registration of welcoming the Torch to Taiwan. This torch of hope symbolized protection of human rights and respect of human life, and also protested the 2008 Olympics held in China without human rights and many unfair discrimination.   The torch relay began at Wembley Stadium where protesters waved flags and chanted as the torch started on its route.  He did, however, say that the style of protesting was "not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the Olympic Games".   A spokesman for Beijing 2008 said “the torch represents the Olympic spirit and people welcome the torch.”   The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit.  As the torch went to London and Paris, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities.   It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the 2008 Summer Olympics.   The next Summer Olympic Games will be held in London in 2012. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declared the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games closed on Sunday.   "The world learned about China — and China learned about the world," he said.
