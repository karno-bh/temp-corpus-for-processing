Wikinews investigates the reconstruction of Pichilemu, Chile after February earthquake

Sunday, October 24, 2010 

Eight months after a catastrophic earthquake, Wikinews has investigated the devastation caused in February and the reconstruction of Pichilemu, Chile. The February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. Wikinews has also had access to the original design plans of the new kiosks in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the Cochayuyo ("El Rey del Cochayuyo"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake. Pichilemu is a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, known as one of the "best surfing spots" in South America. Its current Mayor is Roberto Córdova Carreño, who was elected internally by the Councillors of the city in September 2009, after several political controversies that ended with three Mayors being displaced. The territory of Pichilemu has a surface of 7,491 square kilometers, and comprises at least 24 villages, such as Ciruelos, Rodeíllo and Espinillo (the latter two also severely damaged by the March 11 earthquake). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer. 'The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall': First earthquake strikes
