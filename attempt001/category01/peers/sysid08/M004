Climate conference in Bali begins on Monday Thursday, November 29, 2007This years session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which includes meetings of the COP and CMP, begins next week in Bali, Indonesia. The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks. Setting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in an interview given to Inter Press Service last week. De Boer declared that he does not expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime, and sees the real work in designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that for me Bali is very much a make or a break. The European Commission said in a press release from Tuesday: The [. ] conference [. ] must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement
