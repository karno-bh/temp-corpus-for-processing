The strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti on 12 January left much of the nation in ruins. The epicenter was fifteen kilometers southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince, at a depth of ten kilometers. At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded. Buildings across the capital have collapsed, including hospitals, the Parliament and the headquarters of the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti. Communications and power were out across the city. A strong earthquake (6.1) struck once again Haiti on 20 January, as an international aid effort was underway to help those affected by the previous one. Eleven days after the initial earthquake, the rescue efforts were abandoned and focus was turned to the logistically difficult relief effort. Survivors have been living in makeshift camps. The Haitian president asked for 200,000 tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped. WFP has provided approximately 2 million meals. Even as aid is flowing into the country, survivors face increasing insecurity from convicts escaped from collapsed prisons and human traffickers. Haitian police arrested ten US missionaries who tried to take 33 Haitian children out the country without permissions. Meanwhile, doctors are struggling to treat thousands of injured with limited resources. Lots of injured were flown to the US for medical care. Overall, the earthquake killed exactly 222.570 people and affected 3 million. The economic loss suffered by Haiti reached 7.754 billion dollars. The full reconstruction of the country, described as a "colossal work of reconstruction" by the Haitian Prime Minister, could take several decades.
