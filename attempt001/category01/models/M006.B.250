On January 12, 2010 a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Haiti. Due to the earthquakes severity, information was initially confusing, but later the disasters size was obvious. The first assessments were talking about thousands of deaths and millions of homeless people. According to government sources of Haiti, 60 percent of Haitis gross domestic product was lost under the ruins and also, a large number of government officials and police and military forces were among the earthquake casualties. Thousands of dead remained unburied in the streets, and violence and crime were dramatically rose. On January 20, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake had once again struck Haiti, worsening the situation. The US, the UN and other countries said they would provide all necessary assistance to Haiti. After a period of ten days, it was announced that rescue efforts were going to abandon, although international rescue teams pulled out two people alive in the last days. At the end of the month, the US military had halted the evacuation of victims of the Haiti earthquake for medical care, reportedly due to uncertainty about who would pay for the costs, but immediately the US government announced that the evacuations flights would resume. After the earthquake, a major problem in Haiti was a number of alleged abduction of Haitian children for illegal adoption. At the border with the Dominican Republic 10 US missionaries were arrested, accused of child kidnapping. They tried to take 33 Haitian children out the country without the governments consent.
