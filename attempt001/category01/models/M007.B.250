In January 2005, Corporal Graner was found guilty of abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. He pleaded innocent. In July 2005, Maj. Dinenna, former warden of Abu Ghraib, said in his apology that Maj. Gen. Miller, commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp recommended using dogs because of their effectiveness in prisoners interrogation. During the hearing Sgt. Cardona and Smith were found guilty of abusing prisoners. In October 2005, the federal judge Hellerstein asked disclosure of more information of the abuses, but the Bush administration denied it for safety reasons. In January 2006, Maj. Gen. Miller declined to testify during the court-martial trial for abuse using dogs, invoking his right against self-incrimination. In February 2006, «Dateline», an Australian TV program broadcast, revealed new photos of the abuse that shows Graner having a leading role in the abuse scandal. A few days later the pentagon confirmed the authenticity of the images. The internet news site Salon published some of their own pictures. The US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. In March 2006, the United States stated that the Abu Ghraib prison will be closed. In June 2006, Sgt. Cardona sentenced to 90 days of hard labor. At the same period Human Rights Watch published a report which revealed the extent of torture. Finally, in January 2007 the U.S. army stated that Lt. Col. Jordan will be tried for his involvement in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse case.
