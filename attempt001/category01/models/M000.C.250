U.S. citizens donating in 2005 to help tsunami victims wrote off their donations on their 2004 tax returns. In order to help the earthquake's and tsunami's victims, the world's wealthiest nations poured funding into the damaged region. However, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Indonesia chief, Michael Elmquist, warned that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions is a long lasting procedure. Meanwhile, the  death toll is increased due to dehydration, disease, and starvation. The offered assistance by the U.S. government was considered limited and prompted complaints. At the same time, the ordinary Americans' donations were touching. The scientists determined that the Sumatra's earthquake was the largest ever recorded. People from around the world raised money for the victims as the Romanians who organised telemarathon and other charitable events. On the other hand, a small Canadian village calls back from the Red Cross  the $ 10,000 which had donated as the election day for approving the donation some council members were absent. The Red Cross has already deposited the cheque, but has indicated it will return the money. Only in Indonesia, the death toll reaches 80000. In southern Asia about 1 million people are homeless and humanitarian agencies estimate that 5 million people need relief. The World Health Organization makes hard efforts to improve the conditions. The vast majority of the victims were women. This fact is justified to some extent but requires protection for the female sex.
