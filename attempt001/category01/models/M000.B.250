A week after the earthquake in Southern Asia, the confirmed death count is over 120.000. Indonesia's Aceh province alone counts 80.000 deaths. Sri Lanka announced approximately 28.500, India more than 7.700 and as many as 10.500 foreign citizens are reported missing. As the count continues, a gender imbalance was noticed in deaths by the tsunami, where four times more women than men were killed. This phenomenon is due to the greater physical strength of men and different occupations at the time of the disaster. Because of this phenomenon, many incidents of violence against women have been reported, and it is estimated that they will continue for the time being, therefore the people in charge seek measures to address the problem. The earthquake in Southern Asia was the longest in duration earthquake ever recorded. It lasted between 500 and 600 seconds and released an amount of energy that equals a 100 gigaton bomb, while the gash that was created in the bottom of the sea was measured nearly 800 miles deep. The U.S.A. has committed to offer 350 million dollars to the affected areas, while the U.S. government signed into law on direct tax relief to individuals who have contributed with donations to disaster relief. The amount of donations comes up to 322 million dollars. Japan also offers 500 million dollars. The Romanians raised 395,000 euros in a telethon, while on the other hand a town in Canada demands refund for 10.000 dollars by the Red Cross due to mistake.
