Two years after the seizure of Royal Navy personnel by Iran, two inquiries, that examined the British Ministry's of Defence handling, identified weaknesses in training, communications and the handling of intelligence as well as "collective failure of judgement". The fifteen sailors and marines, from the frigate HMS Cornwall, were captured by Iranian border guards on March 23 in the Persian Gulf, while they were inspecting, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1723, a ship believed to be smuggling cars into Iraq. The UK insisted they were operating in Iraqi waters, while Iran claimed they entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters and that they could face charges of espionage. If those charges were brought against them, the result would be heavy punishment by current Iranian law. On 28 March, British Prime Minister froze all bilateral business deals with Iran. The next day, Iran announced that it will "suspend" the releasing of 15 British personnel, due to the political ballyhoo by London. The EU called the Iranian seizure a "clear breach" of international law. Meanwhile, footage of all 15 British personnel had been broadcast on Iranian TV, with one of the sailors saying that the soldiers were in Iranian waters at the time of their detainment. The British government claimed that the confessions were extracted under duress. Few days later, Iranian President announced that he would free them as a "gift to the British people". The fifteen British navy personnel landed at Heathrow on 5 April, after thirteen days of captivity.
