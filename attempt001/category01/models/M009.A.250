After 16 days of spectacular sporting competition at the Beijing Olympic Village, the President of the International Olympic Committee declared the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games closed. Host China topped the medals table with 51 golds. USA came second with 36, while Russia finished third with 23. The colourful Closing Ceremony, as well as the Opening Ceremony, was held at the iconic Beijing National Stadium. China wanted everything to be perfect. However, officials have confirmed that at least two parts of the opening ceremony were only a visual effect. The torch relay of 2008 Summer Olympics was subject to large scale protests by groups highlighting the human rights issues in China and the situation in Tibet. Protesters tried to grab and extinguish the torch in London. The Olympic torch went out three times in Paris. The route for the torch was altered and, finally, shortened by nearly half in San Francisco, as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. Taiwan refused China'Â’s request on welcoming the torch of 2008 Summer Olympics without Flags, Symbols and the National Song of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Moreover, Epochtimes Taiwan and Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong in China held "Human Rights Torch Relay Night" at Taipei City. This Olympic Torch is first-ever declined by an IOC member without warfare factor and this indicates that the 2008 Summer Olympics has been more faded with politics than previously has occurred. The next Summer Olympic Games will be held in London in 2012.
