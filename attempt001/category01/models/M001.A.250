Tributes paid to the victims of the July 7 2005 London bombings
Four years after the 7/7 London bombings, when 52 people were killed and about 700 were injured by a series of suicide bombings on transport networks, a 1.4 tonne stainless steel plaque with the names of the victims has been unveiled in Hyde Park. 52 stainless steel columns standing 3.5m tall were also inaugurated. All four suicide bombers were UK residents. Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police are unsure of its exact role in the attack. Survivors of the bombings launched a campaign for public inquiry, which was rejected by the British government as too expensive and time-consuming. The government's attitude infuriated survivors and relatives of the dead. According to Scotland Yard, the suicide bombers, whose practice shows 'terrorist methodology', had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier. Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip. Three years after the attacks, footage of the bombers, taken by a CCTV camera nine days before the bombings, has been shown in court as part of the trials of three suspects alleged to be involved in the preparation of the bombings. Meanwhile, five men, all British nationals, were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out fertiliser bombings in the UK. As it was revealed, some of them had met with two of the London subway bombers.
