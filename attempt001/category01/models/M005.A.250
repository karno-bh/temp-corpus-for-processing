The 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile on 27 February 2010 and its subsequent tsunami killed at least 214 people and caused significant structural damage. The giant waves destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street, a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way. Besides Pichilemu, other cities in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, as Lolol, have suffered significant damages as well. On April 4, the first monument was erected in front of the beach of Pichilemu in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. Two weeks earlier, the Mayor of Pichilemu had announced a "tourism revival campaign" whose goal was "to make the city go back to the normality". The reconstruction of Pichilemu began eight months after the catastrophic earthquake. On March 11, Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, just 21 minutes before the country's new president was due to be sworn in. This time there was no subsequent tsunami and no reports of damage, injuries or deaths. A weaker aftershock was recorded on 5 May. At the same time, heavy rains started through the most of central and southern Chile. The rains affected thousands of people that lost their homes after the main earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Dozens of aftershocks were also recorded in the following months. The strongest earthquakes were measured on 14 July (6.5 magnitude), 21 October (5.8 magnitude) and on 28 November (5.6 magnitude).
