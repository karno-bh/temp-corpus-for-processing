Air France Flight 447 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean on June 1st. The aircraft, an Airbus A330-200 that had departed from Rio de Janeiro en route to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members, vanished from radar approximately 190 miles off the Brazilian coast. On June 2, the Brazilian Air Force located bodies and wreckage of the missing Airbus, 650 kilometers from the coast of Brazil. There were no survivors. Autopsies from casualties revealed fractures in leg bones, suggesting that the jet may have been torn apart in midair. Air France said that the airplane "crossed through a thunderous zone with strong turbulence" at about 23.00 local time. Shortly before it disappeared, the plane sent 24 error messages indicating an inconsistent speed, that the auto-pilot was not active and a string of systems failures. The inconsistent airspeed data lead suspicion to fall on the pitot-static system. However, the actual cause of the crash could not be determined without the airplane's flight data recorders. Airbus announced that they were willing to fund an extended search for the black boxes. However, Brazilian officials said that it may be hard to find them due to the large depth of the ocean in the area (2,000 or 3,000 meters). Almost a year later, the black boxes have been localized to within about 2 square miles. They are expected to provide information as to what has caused the world's worst aviation disaster since the November 2001 American Airlines Flight 587 crash.
