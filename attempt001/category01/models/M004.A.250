The U.N. Climate Change Conference which was held in Bali on December 2007 was expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations for an international agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  caps for the period after 2012, which is when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends. Thousands of delegates from more than 180 countries attended the conference. The EU and the vast majority of the participating nations wanted to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions by industrialized nations by 2020. Furthermore, the EU warned that they would not attend the major emitters meeting, if no substantial agreement was reached in Bali. On the other hand, the U.S., along with Canada and Japan, refused to agree to any targets at this point. Finally, after two weeks of negotiations, agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap. The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for GHG emissions. However, the guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations was not included in the final "roadmap", but only in the preamble of the document agreed on only by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon welcomed the outcome of the conference. The EU noted that the agreement was a very important step forward, but made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done.
