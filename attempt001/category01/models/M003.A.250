Alberto Contador of Spain won the 2007 Tour de France general classification. He won by 23 seconds over the second place finisher Cadel Evans and by 31 seconds over Levi Leipheimer, who finished in the third place. Mauricio Soler won the King of the Mountains classification. Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team won the team competition, while Caisse d'Epargne and Team CSC finished second and third, respectively. Le Grand Depart of the 2007 Tour de France was held in London, where the Prologue and Stage One of the Tour had been hosted on 7th and 8th of July, respectively. The sun and the crowds came out to welcome the Tour to London at both days. However, some incidents overshadowed the event. On 25 July, two explosive devices were found on a section of the Tour de France bicycle race just outside the Spanish town of Belagua. The Basque ETA claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route. At the same day, Michael Rasmussen had been withdrawn from the Tour by his team Rabobank -although he had been tested negative for doping - for violating the team's internal rules. Rasmussen, who kept his overall lead in stage 15 by 2' 23' over the final winner Contador, had lied to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in Mexico while he was, in fact, in Italy. Previously, Astana Team had announced that Alexander Vinokourov failed a blood test. Vinokourov, who won stages 13 and 15, was a pre-Tour favorite.
