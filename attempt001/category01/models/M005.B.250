An 8.8 earthquake struck Chile in February 2010 killing 214 people and causing significant damages. Strong tsunami was caused at the coast of Chile. French Polynesia, Hawaii and New Zealand were hit by the waves. In March an earthquake struck Chile again, just a while before the country's new president, Pinera, is sworn in. In May, the VI Congress of Mayors and Councilors of the O'Higgins Region takes place in Pichilemu with main topic the regional reconstruction of the region suffered the devastation. During the same period in this region heavy rains were started making life more difficult for the earthquake victims, destroying their temporary accommodation and creating health problems in vulnerable groups. In this difficult situation, a new 5.5 aftershock hits Chile. The day of the National Monuments of Chile, in May, a group of volunteers began the reconstruction of Lolol. Two aftershocks of the magnitude 5.1 and 5.8 were occurred in central Chile in July and October respectively, causing panic in the population for a new tsunami that eventually didnÂ’t happen. The devastation in the region according to testimonies of the residents was tremendous. Significant monuments of Pichilemu, such as the post office, the Agustin Ross Balcony have been destroyed, while others were severely damaged. The reconstruction of the region set a goal to rebuild the Fishermen Store to stimulate the economy. On April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake victims. Finally, in November, 4 aftershocks hit again without any reports of damage.
