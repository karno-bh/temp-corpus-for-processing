Haiti earthquake left material destruction, deaths, refugees. The lack of communication made it difficult to rescue people, who were underneath rubble. Hospitals had collapsed, raising fears that the injured wouldn't be able to receive treatment. There's an urgent need for rescue volunteers, hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. At least 27 aftershocks followed. The mass media warn of tsunami, although the Atmospheric Administration rejected it. Eight days later left much of the nation in ruins. Officials estimated the initial earthquake killed about 200,000 people and affected three million. According to the President of Haiti was a total disaster. Nine days after the earthquake the government of Haiti put an end to efforts to find any rescue buried survivors. The announcement came just a day after two people were found alive. It was hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation would allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically relief effort. Haiti was facing increasing insecurity from human traffickers and convicts escaped from collapsed prisons. Child trafficking was an other serious issue. The Red Cross and Unicef had started to register orphaned children, and sent some to orphanages for shelter. It's expected that reconstruction could take decades. The remaining forces were rallying as the U.S. military stopped the transport of victims from Haiti because of concerns about the cost of hospitalization. After doctors' calls, the U.S. government resumed its flights for transporting injured despite some objections. The WFP was trying to reduce violence caused by starvation.
