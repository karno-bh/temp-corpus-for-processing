In Bali took place the "United Nations Climate Change Conference". According to Yvo de Boer was important to set an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement.  They focused on whether the developed countries would commit to reduce greenhouse gases.  European nations were pushing for immediate reductions in carbon emissions but environmental activists werenÂ’t as optimistic about progress in the negotiations. According to Yvo de Boer, the negotiations' mood  was positive as a working group of delegates had agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices. Japan and the U.S. advocated the voluntary reductions of carbon emissions, while Al Gore called on them to try on global warming. The director of the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to act decisively as the global warming is a fact. The U.S and China reacted. Hence this disagreement, the United Nations secretary-general, said that setting greenhouse-gas emission targets may have to wait. A key issue in the negotiations was the plan to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries, which was called REDD proposal and was necessary to cover gaps in the Kyoto Protocol. After the U.S agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on and established a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement and included targets for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
