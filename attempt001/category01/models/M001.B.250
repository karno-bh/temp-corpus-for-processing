After the London bombings in July 2005, the British Police searched six houses in Leeds. It was confirmed that the explosives used, came from the building region. At the same time, they announced that all bombers were British citizens and that the surveillance cameras taped them on the day of the bombings near the attacked areas. In order to trace the suspects, two pictures of Hassib Hussain were published and a line was established, so that eye witnesses could testify information related to him. During September 2005, Scotland Yard revealed that the bombers had rehearsed the attacks nine days earlier, according to statements and CCTV tapes. Also, during the same period, the suspect for the attacks Hussain Osman was extradited to the UK by the Italian authorities. On December 2005, the survivors of the attacks participated in the promotion campaign for public inquiry into the terrorist's attacks, trying to push the government to give up the solution of narration of events by eye witnesses. A year after the attacks, Londoners honored the victims. Officials laid flowers at the location of the explosions and the prime minister made statements. On May 2007 five suspects were found guilty for their part in an unsuccessful plot to carry out bombings in the UK. While a year after, in the trial of the suspects for the attacks of 2005, the jury was shown footage of their moves. Finally, two years after the attacks, 52 stainless steel columns were placed in memory of the victims.
