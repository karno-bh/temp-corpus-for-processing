On early December 2007 began the proceedings of the UN conference about climate change in Bali. It was extremely important because the participants should be agreed for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas emissions for 2012, given the fact the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. At the beginning of the conference, discussions focused on the developed countries commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. The EU suggested rapid reduce, but environmentalists were pessimist. Then, delegates from about 190 countries were negotiating a plan for private companies and wealthy nations to pay poorer nations to keep their forest intact. It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal. Al Gore expressed the view that the US and China had to make more efforts, in order to protect the environment against global warming. Also Ban Ki-Moon said that countries must find a common ground on climate protection. After almost two weeks of negotiations, the EU threatened, pushing the US, it would not participate in another meeting, if a substantial agreement did not take place in Bali. After the US agreed to the changes proposed by India, the so called Bali Roadmap had been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The Roadmap established the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions, amongst other things.
