London Metropolitan Police searched six houses in Leeds in order to find elements about the terrorist attacks on july 7. The raids were dangerous and long lasting. The suspects of the bombings in London are all British nationals. Four of them alleged suicide bombers. The Metropolitan Police released two photographs of one of the London bombers and made a request for any additional information about his whearabouts in order to succeed in arresting him. Another bomb suspect, Hussain Osman, who was accused of planting the failed bomb at the Underground station,  arrived in London and had been arrested following his extradition from Italy. Survivors of the London Bombings set up an online petition calling for an independent Public Inquiry into the attacks.
 The British government rejected calls for a Public Inquiry. But survivors argue that a comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services. One year after the terrorist attacks, the Londoners honor the memory of victims. Simultaneously, a video links the attacks with Al-Qaeda.
In 2007, five men were found guilty of plotting to cause an explosion and have been jailed with life sentences. Some of the fertiliser bomb conspirators had met with two of the London subway bombers. A court in the United Kingdom has been shown footage of the bombers that attacked London. Four years later, London remembers the vistims of terrorism and the police goes on investigating the case, thoroughly.
