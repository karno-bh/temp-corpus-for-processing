In March 2007 a British frigate with 15 Navy personnel, including a woman, have been captured by Iranian authorities, while they were investigating a ship suspected of smuggling cars in Iraq , on charges that they entered illegally into Iran's territorial waters. The detainees were taken in Tehran and unofficial information indicated that if they charge them with espionage, the result would be heavy punishment. Britain reacted immediately. "COBRA emergency committee" was activated. Blair expressed his disappointment and he demanded their immediate release. He also stated that he wishes a peaceful solution for the issue. U.S.A and E.U expressed their support and their claim for immediate release. The coordinates of Iranians about the location of the ship wasnÂ’t true according to Britain and threatened to cease all business deals with Iran. The next days and although originally Iranians stated that they would release the female prisoner, they changed terms due to the hot negotiations. The Iranians, however, stated that the prisoners were in good health and their detention was decent. After 13 days of captivity Ahmadinejad announced that they would be released as a "gift to the British people." After a ceremony they returned to London. One detainee said that during their captivity they suffered mental stress and that they have admitted the category in order to deter further tensions. Finally, two surveys conducted after a month concluded that the rapture was the result of unfortunate accumulation of factors rather than human mistake.
