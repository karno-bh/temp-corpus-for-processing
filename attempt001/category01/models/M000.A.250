Dec. 2004 Sumatra earthquake was the longest-lasting ever recorded and large enough to vibrate the whole planet!
A week after tsunami waves scoured the coasts of multiple countries in southern Asia, the UN says the final death toll could climb beyond 150,000 and may never be known, while it is estimated that 5 million people lack food, water or basic sanitation necessary for survival.  It should also be noted that women killed outnumber men. The world's wealthiest nations have begun pouring funding into the Earthquake/Tsunami damaged region. Japanese Prime Minister announced a half-billion dollar donation, China has promised $60.5 million, while Norway increased its funding donation to $180 million. The Bush administration has pledged $350 million. Moreover, Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy is estimating approximately $322 million in goods and cash have been donated by private U.S. citizens and corporations. The Romanian Government pledged 150,000 euro, while the Romanian public raised 395,000 euro in a telethon for the tsunami victims. In addition, Romanian artists will auction off their works, as well as personal objects, with all proceeds being donated to the relief efforts. Despite the encouraging promises, the UN warns that logistics of securing the funds, purchasing supplies and shipping them to stricken regions will take time. Meanwhile, deaths due to dehydration, disease and starvation will continue to climb. In this entire situation, the municipal council of Saskatchewan town in Canada says it "accidentally" donated $10,000 to the Red Cross for tsunami relief and now asks for its money back!
