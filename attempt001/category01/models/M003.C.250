Le Grand Depart of the 2007 Tour de France was held in London, where the Prologue and Stage One of the Tour had been hosted on 7th and 8th of July, respectively. During this institution, Cancellara won twice in  time trial and had been acclaimed by the audience. Despite the shadow of terrorist attacks, policing was discreet. In the event, Michael Rasmussen had been withdrawn from the Tour by his team Rabobank as he had violated internal regulations of his group. Rasmussen, who kept his overall lead in stage 15 by 2' 23' over the final winner Contador, had lied to the team about his whereabouts in June, saying he was in Mexico while he was, in fact, in Italy. In cycling team, Discovery Channel won. Hincapie led his team and led it to victory. Astana cycling team announced that Vinokourov failed a blood test following his victory in time trial. Tour organizers had asked Astana Cycling Team to leave the race, which had been accepted spontaneously. Vinokourov denied any blood manipulation. The event caused a lot of comments. Two explosive devices were found on a section of the Tour de France bicycle race just outside the Spanish town of Belagua.  There were no reports of injuries but conflicting reports mentioned that the cyclists had passed the area before the devices went off, while others reported that the devices were detonated before the cyclists passed. ETA claimed responsibility for placing the devices on the route.
