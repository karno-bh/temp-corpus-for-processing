Pictures of extensive detainee abuse in Abu Ghraib were made public in early 2004. A year later, a United States Army court martial sentenced Army Spc. Graner to ten years in prison. A total of eleven American soldiers were found guilty in allegations stemming from the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal. Among them, two dog handler soldiers. During their testimony, they said they learned the interrogation techniques that included the use of dogs from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from Guantanamo military base. On September 2005, a U.S. federal judge ordered the release of additional photos and video relating to the case. The Bush administration claimed that the ordered media could provoke terrorist attacks. Five months later, the Australian TV station SBS showed new photos claiming that some of them document previously unprosecuted abuse. According to a report published on June 2006 by Human Rights Watch, torture and other abuses against detainees in US custody in Iraq continued and were authorized. The Department of Defense denied any Pentagon approval for any abuse. On January 2007, the U.S. Army announced that U.S. Lt. Col. Steven Lee Jordan was going to be tried by a military court. Jordan is the only U.S. officer charged in the Abu Ghraib case. A year earlier, a top US commander, who supervised the detention and interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib facilities, had declined to testify in a court-martial proceeding, by invoking his right to not implicate himself.
