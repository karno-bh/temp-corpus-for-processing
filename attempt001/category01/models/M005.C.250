The 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile on 27 February 2010 and its subsequent tsunami killed at least 214 people and caused significant structural damage. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had announced that a tsunami warning was in effect for much of the Pacific Rim. According to news agencies "large waves" had already struck a lot of areas. Heavy rains had started through the most of central and southern Chile and had caused serious damages to roads and people. Large aftershocks rocked Chile. Indeed, an aftershock occurred shortly before the country's new president was due to be sworn in. Chileans and artists came to Lolol, a national monument in Chile in order to help repair the damage. Pichilemu was a coastal city which had received strong shocks by the earthquake and tsunami. The giant waves destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street, a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way.  On April 4, the first monument was erected in front of the beach of Pichilemu in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. 
 Eight months later, it is going to begin the reconstruction of the region, the boost of tourism and the support of citizens. The Sixth Conference of Mayors and Counsellors of  the O'Higgins Region is going to take place in Pichilemu and it is going to deal  with regional restructuring and ways of managing health problems, education, housing for each municipality.
